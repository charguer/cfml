# Readme
#
# $(OCAML_INCLUDE) should contain -I directives (with absolute paths).
# Optionally, $(CFML_FLAGS) can be set (e.g. to "-rectypes").
# Optionally, $(ML) can be used to specify the sources files (default: *.ml)
#
# For each %.ml file in $(ML), we create:
# - the files %.d      (dependency files)
# - the files %.cmj    (type information; .cmi files in disguise)
# - the files %_ml.v   (characteristic formulae)
# - the files %_ml.vo  (compiled characteristic formulae)
#
# Idea number 1:
# Because the CFML generator produces the files %_ml.v and %.cmj at
# the same time (in just one invocation), it is not necessary to
# tell "make" about both of these files. We adopt the convention
# that only the .cmj file is used as a target. This seems to help.
#
# Idea number 2:
# This Makefile deals only with the generation of %_ml.v and %.cmj.
# Running Coq on %_ml.v is the job of another Makefile, which is
# run in a second stage. This means we write fewer Makefiles, they
# are really independent, and dependency computations are simpler.

# Verbosity control.

# Our commands are pretty long (due, among other things, to the use of
# absolute paths everywhere). So, we hide them by default, and echo a short
# message instead. However, sometimes one wants to see the command.

# By default, VERBOSE is undefined, so the .SILENT directive is read, so no
# commands are echoed. If VERBOSE is defined by the user, then the .SILENT
# directive is ignored, so commands are echoed, unless they begin with an
# explicit @.

# Dependencies

# As described by the recipe below, including the dependency files $(D)
# adds dependencies of the form:
#   A.cmj: B.cmj
# whenever module A depends on module B.

ifeq ($(findstring $(MAKECMDGOALS),clean),)
-include $(D)
endif

# We use ocamldep to find out which files A depends upon.

# ocamldep must be passed appropriate -I flags, as it searches the file system
# to find where each module is stored. We assume that these flags are given by
# $(OCAML_INCLUDE).
# By using ocamldep in this way, we obtain dependencies that mention absolute
# path names, as desired. We cannot use ocamldep -modules because it does not
# perform this search and does not produce absolute path names.

# ocamldep does not reliably print absolute path names -- its output depends
# on the current directory! it omits the absolute path if it coincides with
# the current directory. So, we change the current directory to /tmp before
# invoking ocamldep.

# ocamldep produces the following dependencies:
#   A.cmo: B.cmi (or B.cmo, depending on the existence of B.mli, I think)
#   A.cmx: B.cmx (or B.cmi, depending on obscure criteria)
# We keep only the second line and replace both .cmx and .cmi with .cmj in it.

# ocamldep sometimes produces a dependency A.cmx: A.cmi (not sure why).
# This leads us to produce a circular dependency A.cmj: A.cmj.
# The script $(OCAMLPOST) filters it out.

# Rules

# We use CFML's cmj generator to produce %_ml.v and %.cmj files out of %.ml.
# Only the %.cmj target is known to "make".

# We include a dependency on the executable [cfmlc]. This is not strictly
# required, but can be helpful for us (developers) who tend to frequently
# reinstall CFML and do not always remember to run [make clean] in every
# project that uses CFML.
