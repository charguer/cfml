# TO DO

* Update the main `Makefile`. Note that `lib/stdlib` will not compile
  unless the first two packages have been installed.

* Create a `.gitattributes` file so as to limit the content of the
  distributed archive.

* Include the auxiliary Makefiles in one of the opam packages.

* Include the documentation in one of the opam packages.

* Write a release script to release all packages simultaneously.
  Replace DATEDASH in the `.opam` files.

* Update the README.

* See if something can be done about the Coq warnings that have been
  deactivated (see `lib/coq/_CoqProject`).
