# TO DO

* Use `CFML ?= ...`. Use `-include Makefile.local`.
  Generate `_CoqProject`.
  Think about merging `Makefile` and `Makefile.dev` under a conditional.

* Update the release scripts. (Replace DATEDASH in the `.opam` files.)

* Create some form of documentation, and link to it from `README.md`.

* See if something can be done about the Coq warnings that have been
  deactivated (see `lib/coq/_CoqProject`).
