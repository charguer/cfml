# TO DO

* Use `CFML ?= ...`.
  Use `-include Makefile.local`.
  Merge `Makefile` and `Makefile.dev` under a conditional.

* README.md: note that `opam pin add` is the correct command.

* Update the release scripts. (Replace DATEDASH in the `.opam` files.)

* Create some form of documentation, and link to it from `README.md`.

* See if something can be done about the Coq warnings that have been
  deactivated (see `lib/coq/_CoqProject`).
