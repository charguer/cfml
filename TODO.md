# TO DO

* Merge `Makefile` and `Makefile.dev` under a conditional.

* Update the release scripts. (Replace DATEDASH in the `.opam` files.)

* Create some form of documentation, and link to it from `README.md`.

* See if something can be done about the Coq warnings that have been
  deactivated (see `lib/coq/_CoqProject`).
