# TO DO

* Update the main `Makefile`. Note that `lib/stdlib` will not compile
  unless the first two packages have been installed.

* Write a release script to release all packages simultaneously.
  Replace DATEDASH in the `.opam` files.

* Update the README. Explain the end user workflow and the developer
  workflow.

* Create some form of documentation, and link to it from `README.md`.

* See if something can be done about the Coq warnings that have been
  deactivated (see `lib/coq/_CoqProject`).
