# Installation

Installation using opam.


```
   # create an opam switch for CFML2
   opam switch cfml_8.7.2 -A 4.05.0
   `opam config env`

   # install Coq at the right version
   opam pin add coq 8.7.2
   opam install coqide

   # install MoSel
   opam repo add iris-dev https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/opam-dev.git
   opam update
   opam install coq-iris=dev.2018-07-13.0.cbf73155

   # install TLC from package
   opam repo add coq-released http://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
   opam update
   opam install coq-tlc.20180316  

   # compile CFML2
   cd ~/cfml2
   make
   # alternative: make -j4

```


Remarks:

* The general-purpose Coq library called TLC is required for all files.
  It is available from opam (package name "coq-tlc").
  
  Alternatively, one can also use TLC from sources:
     https://gitlab.inria.fr/charguer/tlc
  in which case you'll to add a file "settings.sh" with contents, e.g.
  "TLC=~/tlc/src"


* The MoSel proof mode is required for the compilation of 
  files that depend on the proof mode. It is available via opam:
  `opam install coq-iris=branch.gen_proofmode.2018-05-29.0.9b14f90a`

# Execution using CoqIDE

If everything works fine, the files can be executed using CoqIDE, e.g.:

```
   coqide ExampleROMosel.v
```

Note that CoqIDE uses the file `_CoqProject` generated by the Makefile 
(by `make all`, or more specifically by `make _CoqProject`) to figure
out the paths to the libraries. For example, the contents of `_CoqProject`
might be:

```
   -R /home/charguer/.opam/4.05.0/lib/coq/user-contrib/TLC TLC -R /home/charguer/cfml2_master/theories Sep
```

If for some reason this setup fails, then CoqIDE would complain with 
an error of the form:

```
   Cannot find a physical path bound to logical path matching suffix
   <> and prefix Sep.
```

Note that it is possible to invoke CoqIDE with explicit arguments, e.g.:

```
   coqide -R /home/charguer/.opam/4.05.0/lib/coq/user-contrib/TLC TLC -R /home/charguer/cfml2_master/theories Sep ExampleROMosel.v
```

Note that CoqIDE often executes faster with multithreading turned off:

```
   coqide -async-proofs off -async-proofs-command-error-resilience off 
```

# Models of Separation Logics for a simple imperative lambda-calculus

This archive contains definitions and proofs of soundness for several
Separation Logics.

The plain Separation Logic and the characteristic formulae
(used for more smoothly integrating Separation Logic into interactive
proofs) is close to that described in Arthur Charguéraud's lecture notes, 
available from:
  http://www.chargueraud.org/teach/verif/seplogic.pdf


The Separation Logic equipped with time credits is described in:
__Verifying the correctness and amortized complexity of a union-find
implementation in separation logic with time credits__
by Arthur Charguéraud and François Pottier, JAR 2017
  http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/publis/chargueraud-pottier-uf-sltc.pdf

The Separation Logic equipped with read-only permissions is described in:
__Temporary Read-Only Permissions for Separation Logic__
by Arthur Charguéraud and François Pottier
(ESOP 2017).
  http://www.chargueraud.org/research/2017/readonlysep/readonlysep.pdf
