# For some reason, running [dune install] or [dune uninstall] in the
# current directory causes it to create a [dune-project] file in this
# directory, even though there is one in the parent directory. To
# avoid this, we move up to the parent directory first.

# For some reason, running [dune install -p cfml] does not work; dune
# complains about the presence of other packages, which it does not
# know how to install. Fortunately, [dune install cfml] seems to work.

# [make versions] compiles CFML with several versions of OCaml.
