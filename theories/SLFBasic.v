(** * Chapter in a rush, nested with exercises as additional contents *)

(** This chapter gives a quick overview of how to state specifications and
    carry out basic proofs in Separation Logic using CFML tactics.

    In this chapter, we will present:

    - "Heap predicates", which are used to describe memory states in
       Separation Logic.
    - "Specification triples", of the form [TRIPLE _ PRE _ POST _].
      Such specification relate a term, a precondition, and a postcondition.
    - "Verification proof obligations", of the form [PRE _ CODE _ POST _].
      These proof obligations also correspond to specification triples, yet
      they feature the description of the current state as first argument
      in order to improve readability of proof obligations.
    - "Entailment proof obligations", of the form [_ ==> _] or [_ ===> _].
      Such entailments require proving that a description of a state implies
      another one.
    - Practical verification proofs, using CFML "x-tactics" to demonstrate
      that a given program satisfies a given specification.

    The "heap predicates" used to describe memory states include:
    - [p ~~> n], which describes a memory cell at location [p] with contents [n],
    - [\[]], which describes an empty state,
    - [\[P]], which asserts that a proposition [P] is true (in an empty state),
    - [H1 \* H2], which describes a state made of two disjoint parts: [H1] and [H2],
    - [\exists x, H], which is used to quantify variables in postconditions.

    All these heap predicates admit the type [hprop], which consists of predicate
    over memory states. In other words, [hprop] is defined as [state->Prop].

    The verification proofs are carried out using CFML "x-tactics", as their
    name begins with the letter "x". These tactics include:
    - [xwp] or [xtriple] to being a proof (in case of failure, try [xwp_debug]),
    - [xapp] to reason about an application (in case of failure, try [xapp_debug]),
    - [xval] to reason about a return value,
    - [xsimpl] to simplify or prove entailments ([_ ==> _] or [_ ===> _]). *)

(** In addition to x-tactics, the verification proof scripts exploit standard
    Coq tactics, as well as tactics from the TLC library. The relevant TLC
    tactics, which are described when first use, include:
    - [math], which is a variant of [omega] for proving mathematical goals,
    - [induction_wf], which sets up proofs by well-founded induction,
    - [gen], which is a shorthand for [generalize dependent], a tactic
      also useful to set up induction principles.

(** ** The increment function *)

(** As first example, consider the function [incr], which increments
    the contents of a mutable cell that stores an integer.
    In OCaml syntax, this function is defined as:

[[
  let incr p =
    p := !p + 1
]]

    The actual CFML tool features a parser able to process OCaml syntax.
    Yet, throughout this course, to avoid dependency on an external tool,
    we will input all programs using a custom set of Coq notation for
    describing imperative programs. There is no need to learn how to write
    programs in this funny syntax: the source code for all the programs
    involved in this course is provided.

    Below is the code for the function [incr]. This function is a value,
    so it admits, like all values in the CFML framework, the type [val].

    The quotes that appear in the source code are used to disambiguate
    between the keywords and variables associated with the source code,
    and those from the corresponding Coq keywords and variables.
    The [VFun] keyword should be read like the [fun] keyword.

    Again, the details of this funny syntax are not important, the reader
    may blindly trust that it corresponds to the OCaml code shown above.
*)

Definition incr : val :=
  VFun 'p :=
   'p ':= '! 'p '+ 1.

(** Let [p] be the address in memory of the reference cell provided as
    argument to the increment function. In technical vocabulary, [p]
    is the "location" of a reference cell. In CFML, locations have type
    [loc], thus the argument [p] of [incr] has type [loc].

    In Separation Logic, the "heap predicate" [p ~~> n] describes a memory
    state in which the contents of the location [p] is the value [n].
    In the present example, [n] denotes an integer value.

    The behavior of the operation [incr p] consists of updating the memory
    state by incrementing the contents of the cell at location [p], so that
    its new contents is [n+1]. Thus, the memory state posterior to the
    increment operation can be described by the heap predicate [p ~~> (n+1)].

    The result value returned by [incr p] is the [unit] value. There is not
    much to specify about the result value, beyond the fact that it has
    type [unit]. In the specification of [incr], the notation
    [fun (r:unit) => ...] indicates that the result has type [unit].

    The specification of [incr p], shown below, is expressed using a
    "Separation Logic triple", stated using the custom notation
    [TRIPLE _ PRE _ POST _], whose compontents are explained next. *)

Lemma Triple_incr : forall (p:loc) (n:int),
  TRIPLE (incr p)
    PRE (p ~~> n)
    POST (fun (r:unit) => (p ~~> (n+1))).

(** The components form this specification are as follows:

    - [forall (p:loc) (n:int)] quantifies the argument of the function
      (here, [p]), as well as the "ghost argument" (here, [n]) which is used
      to describe the input state.
    - The keyword [TRIPLE] introduces the expression [incr p], which is the
      function being specified.
    - The keyword [PRE] introduces the "precondition", which describes the
      input state that the function expects, here [p ~~> n].
    - The keyword [POST] introduces the "postcondition", which describes
      both the output value and the output state produced by the call.
      The pattern [fun (r:unit) => _] binds the name [r] to denote the result
      value; here [r] has type unit, reflecting the type of [incr p].
      Finally, the expression [p ~~> (n+1)] describes the output state. *)

(** Remark: we have to write [p ~~> (n+1)] using parentheses around [n+1],
    because [p ~~> n+1] would get parsed as [(p ~~> n) + 1]. *)

(** Our next step is to prove the specification lemma [Triple_incr] which
    specifies the behavior of the function [incr]. We conduct the
    verification proof using CFML tactics.

    The CFML tooling will transform on-the-fly the code so that all
    intermediate expressions are named, that is, by putting the code
    in "A-normal form". In OCaml syntax, the A-normal could be written:

[[
  let incr p =
    let m =
      let n = !p in
      n + 1 in
    p := m
]]

    The transformation into A-normal form is performed by the tactic [xwp],
    which begins every CFML verification proof script. The tactic [xwp]
    also sets up the goal in the form that is ready for verification using
    CFML "x-tactics". What happens behind the scene is explained much later
    in the chapter [SLFWPgen]. For now, we focus on the high-level aspect
    of the proofs, from an end-user point of view.
*)

Proof using.
  xwp.     (* Begin the verification proof. The proof obligation is
              displayed using the custom notation [PRE _ CODE _ POST _].
              The [CODE] part does not look very nice, but one should
              be able to somehow recognize the body of [incr]. Indeed,
              if we ignorine the details, and perform the relevant
              alpha-renaming, the [CODE] section reads like:
[[
              Let m :=
                  Let n := App val_get p in
                  App val_add n 1
                  in
               App val_set p m
]]
              which is similar to the OCaml syntax in A-normal form.
   *)

 (*  The remaining of the proof performs some form of symbolic
     execution. One should not attempt to read the full proof
     obligation at each step, but instead only look at the current
     state, described by the [PRE] part (here, [p ~~> n]), and at
     the first line only of the [CODE] part, where one can read
     the code of the next operation to reason about.

     Each function call is handled using the tactic [xapp]. *)

  xapp.    (* Reason about the the operation [!p] that reads into [p];
              the read operation returns the value [n]. *)

  xapp.    (* Reason about the update operation [p := n+1],
              thereby updating the state to [p ~~> (n+1)]. *)
  xsimpl.  (* At this stage, the proof obligation takes the form [_ ==> _],
              which require checking that the final state matches what
              is claimed in the postcondition. [xsimpl] takes care of it. *)
Qed.

(** The command below associates the specification lemma [Triple_incr]
    with the function [incr] in a database, so that if we subsequently
    verify a program that features a call to [incr], the [xapp] tactic
    is able to automatically invoke the lemma [Triple_incr]. *)

(** Remark: there is no need to understand the internal magic of how
    this database of specification is implemented by hacking Coq's
    [Hint] mechanism. *)

(** *** A function with a return value *)

(** As second example, we describe a function that performs simple
    arithmetic computations. The function, whose code appears below,
    expects an integer argument [n], computes [a] as [n+1], then
    computes [b] as [n-1], and finally returns [a+b]. The function
    thus always returns [2*n].

[[
  let example_let n =
    let a = n + 1 in
    let b = n - 1 in
    a + b
]]
*)

Definition example_let : val :=
  VFun 'n :=
    Let 'a := 'n '+ 1 in
    Let 'b := 'n '- 1 in
    'a '+ 'b.

(** We specify this function using the the triple notation, in the form
    [TRIPLE (example_let n) PRE _ POST (fun (r:int) => _ )], where [r]
    denotes the output value. This time, the output value has type [int].

    To denote the fact that the input state is empty, we write [\[]]
    in the precondition, that is, after the [PRE] keyword.

    To denote the fact that the output state is empty, we could use [\[]].
    Yet, if we write [fun (r:int) => \[]] as postcondition, we would have
    said nothing about the output value [r] produced by a call [example_let].
    Instead, we would like to specify that the result [r] is equal to [2*n].
    To that end, we write [fun (r:int) => \[r = 2*n]] after the [POST] keyword. *)

Lemma Triple_example_let : forall (n:int),
  TRIPLE (example_let n)
    PRE \[]
    POST (fun (r:int) => \[r = 2*n]).

(** The verification proof script is very similar to the previous one.
    The x-tactics [xapp] performs symbolic execution of the code.
    Ultimately, we need to check that the expression computed,
    [(n + 1) + (n - 1)], is equal to the specified result, that is, [2*n].
    We exploit the TLC tactics [math] to prove this mathematical result. *)

Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. xapp. xapp. xsimpl. math.
Qed.

(** In the proof above, we have eargerly substituted [a] with [n+1],
    then substituted [b] with [n-1]. Such eager substitutions generally
    work well for small programs, yet in larger programs doing so can lead
    to exponential blow-ups in the size of the terms being manipulated.
    To avoid such blow-ups, it may be necessary to preserve explicit
    equalities, such as [a = n+1] and [b = n-1], in the proof context.

    In general, it is desirable to let the user control when substitutions
    should or should not be performed. Where the [xapp] tactic systematically
    attempts to perfom a substitution, its variant [xapp_nosubst] instead
    introduces an explicit equality, as illustrated next. *)

(** *** Increment of two references *)

(** Consider the following function, which expects the addresses
    of two reference cells, and increments both of them.

[[
  let incr_two p q =
    incr p;
    incr q
]]
*)

Definition incr_two : val :=
  VFun 'p 'q :=
    incr 'p ';
    incr 'q.

(** The specificaiton of this function takes the form
    [TRIPLE (incr_two p q) PRE _ POST (fun (r:unit) => _ )],
    where [r] denotes the result value of type unit.

    The precondition describes two references cells: [p ~~> n]
    and [q ~~> m]. To assert that the two cells are distinct from
    each other, we separate their description with the operator [\*].
    This operator called "separating conjunction" in Separation Logic,
    and is also known as the "star" operator. Thus, the precondition
    is [(p ~~> n) \* (q ~~> m)], or simply [p ~~> n \* q ~~> m].

    The postcondition describes the final state as
    is [p ~~> (n+1) \* q ~~> (m+1)], where the contents of both
    cells is increased by one unit compared with the precondition.

    The specification triple for [incr_two] is thus as follows. *)

Lemma Triple_incr_two : forall (p q:loc) (n m:int),
  TRIPLE (incr_two p q)
    PRE (p ~~> n \* q ~~> m)

Qed.

(** We register the specification [Triple_incr_two] in the
    database, to enable reasoning about calls to [incr_two]. *)

Hint Extern 1 (Register_Spec incr_two) => Provide Triple_incr_two.


(* ########################################################### *)
(** *** Aliased arguments *)

(** The specification [Triple_incr_two] correctly describes calls to the
    function [incr_two] when providing it with two distinct reference cells.
    Yet, it says nothing about a call of the form [incr_two p p].

    Indeed, in Separation Logic, a state described by [p ~~> n] cannot
    be matched against a state described by [p ~~> n \* p ~~> n], because
    the star operator requires its operand to correspond to disjoint pieces
    of state.

    What happens if we nevertheless try to exploit [Triple_incr_two]
    to reason about a call of the form [incr_two p p], that is, with
    aliased arguments?

    Let's find out, by considering the operation [aliased_call p],
    which does execute such a call. *)

Definition aliased_call : val :=
  VFun 'p :=
    incr_two 'p 'p.

(** A call to [aliased_call p] should increase the contents of [p] by [2].
    This property can be specified as follows. *)

Lemma Triple_aliased_call : forall (p:loc) (n:int),
  TRIPLE (aliased_call p)
    PRE (p ~~> n)
    POST (fun (r:unit) => p ~~> (n+2)).

(** If we attempt the proof, we get stuck. Observe how [xapp] reports its
    failure to make progress. *)

Proof using.
  xwp. xapp.
Abort.

(** In the above proof, we get stuck with a proof obligation of the form:
    [\[] ==> (p ~~> ?m) \* _], which requires showing that
    from an empty state one can extract a reference [p ~~> ?m]
    for some integer [?m].

    What happened is that when matching the current state [p ~~> n]
    against [p ~~> ?n \* p ~~> ?m] (which corresponds to the precondition
    of [Triple_incr_two] with [q = p]), the internal simplification tactic
    was able to cancel out [p ~~> n] in both expressions, but then got
    stuck with matching the empty state against [p ~~> ?m]. *)

(** The issue here is that the specification [Triple_incr_two] is
    specialized for the case of non-aliased references.

    It is possible to state and prove an alternative specification for
    the function [incr_two], to cover the case of aliased arguments.
    Its precondition mentions only one reference, [p ~~> n], and its
    postcondition asserts that its contents gets increased by two units.

    This alternative specification can be stated and proved as follows. *)

(** By exploiting the alternative specification, we are able to verify

    In order to indicate to the [xapp] tactic that it should invoke
    the lemma [Triple_incr_two_aliased] and not [Triple_incr_two],
    we pass that lemma as argument to [xapp], by writing
    [xapp Triple_incr_two_aliased]. *)

    [xtriple], which turns a specification triple of the form
    [TRIPLE _ PRE _ POST _] into the form [PRE _ CODE _ POST _],

    which describes the address of the freshly allocated cell.
    Moreover, it should assert that the memory state is of
    the form [p ~~> m], for some [m] such that [0 <= m < n].

    We can use the star operator to join the two pieces of
    information [p ~~> m] and [0 <= m < n] in the postcondition.
    Doing so, we would obtain:

    Yet, this statement does not typecheck because [m] is unbound.

    To fix the issue, we need to exploit a new Separation Logic operator:
    the existential quantifier. Its syntax is [\exists x, _].
    Observe the use of a leading backslash to distinguish from Coq's
    standard existential quantifier.

(** *** Deallocation in Separation Logic *)

(** Separation Logic tracks allocated data. In its standard setup,
    Separation Logic enforces that all allocated data be eventually
    deallocated. (Technically, the logic is said to "linear" as opposed
    to "affine".) *)

(** Let us illustrate what happens when we forget to deallocate data.
    To that end, consider the following program, which computes
    the successor of a integer [n] by storing it into a reference cell,
    then incrementing that reference, and finally returning its contents.

(** *** Axiomatization of the mathematical factorial function *)

(** Our next example consists of a program that evaluate the
    factorial function. To specify this function, we consider
    a Coq axiomatization of the mathematical factorial function,
    which is called [facto]. *)

Parameter facto : int -> int.

Parameter facto_init : forall n,
  0 <= n <= 1 ->
  facto n = 1.

Parameter facto_step : forall n,
  n > 1 ->
  facto n = n * (facto (n-1)).

(** Remark: throught this axiomatization, we purposely do not specify
    the value of [facto] on negative arguments. *)


(* ########################################################### *)
(** *** A partial recursive function, without state *)

(** In the rest of the chapter, we will consider recursive
    functions that manipulate the state. To gently introduce
    the necessary technique for reasoning about recursive
    functions, we first consider a recursive function that does
    not involve any mutable state.

    The function [factorec] computes the factorial of its argument.

[[
  let rec factorec n =
    if n <= 1 then 1 else n * factorec (n-1)
]]

*)

Definition factorec : val :=
  VFix 'f 'n :=
    If_ 'n '<= 1 Then 1 Else 'n '* 'f ('n '- 1).

(** A call [factorec n] can be specified as follows:

    - the initial state is empty,
    - the final state is empty,
    - the result value [r] is such that [r = facto n] when [n >= 0].

    In case the argument is negative (i.e., [n < 0]), we have two choices:

    - either we explicitly specify that the result is [1] in this case,
    - or we rule out this possibility by requiring [n >= 0].

    Let us follow the second approach, in order to illustrate the
    specification of partial functions. There are yet two possibilities
    for expressing the constraint [n >= 0]:

    - either we use as precondition [\[n >= 0]],
    - or we place an asssumption [(n >= 0) -> _] to the front of the triple,
      and use an empty precondition, that is, [\[]].

    The two presentations are totally equivalent. By convention, we follow
    the second presentation, which tends to improve the readability of
    specifications and the conciseness of proof scripts.

    The specification of [factorec] is thus stated as follows. *)

  n >= 0 ->

    how to set up the induction, how to reason about the recursive call,
    and how to deal with the precondition [n >= 0]. *)

Proof using.
  (* We set up a proof by induction on [n] to obtain an induction
     hypothesis for the recursive calls. Recursive calls are made
     each time on smaller values, and the last recursive call is
     made on [n = 1]. The well-founded relation [downto 1] captures
     this recursion pattern. The tactic [induction_wf] is provided
     by the TLC library to assist in setting up well-founded inductions.
     It is exploited as follows. *)
  intros n. induction_wf IH: (downto 1) n.
  (* Observe the induction hypothesis [IH]. By unfolding [downto]
     as done in the next step, this hypothesis asserts that the
     specification that we are trying to prove already holds for
     arguments that are smaller than the current argument [n],
     and that are greater than or equal to [1]. *)
  unfold downto in IH.
  (* We may then begin the interactive verification proof. *)
  intros Hn. xwp.
  (* We reason about the evaluation of the boolean condition [n <= 1]. *)
  xapp.
  (* The result of the evaluation of [n <= 1] in the source program
     is described by the boolean value [isTrue (n <= 1)], which appears
     in the [CODE] section after [Ifval]. The operation [isTrue] is
     provided by the TLC library as a conversion function from [Prop]
     to [bool]. The use of such a conversion function (which leverages
     classical logic) greatly simplifies the process of automatically
     performing substitutions after calls to [xapp]. *)
