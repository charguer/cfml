(** * The chapter in a rush *)

(** In the previous chapter, we have introduced a predicate called [wp]
    to describe the weakest precondition of a term [t] with respect to 
    a given postcondition [Q]. The weakest precondition [wp] is defined
    by the equivalence [H ==> wp t Q] if and only if [triple t H Q].

    This definition gives a "semantics" to [wp], for which reasoning
    rules can be proved. For example, [wp (trm_seq t1 t2) Q] is 
    entailed by [wp t1 (fun r => wp t2 Q)], as captured by lemma [wp_seq].

    In this chapter, we introduce a function to "compute" [wpgen t Q]
    recursively over the structure of the term [t]. For example,
    [wpgen t Q] is essentially defined as [wpgen t1 (fun r => wpgen t2 Q)].

    The intention is for [wpgen t Q] to recursively construct a heap predicate
    that has the same interpretation [wp t Q], but that can be directly
    used for interactive reasoning about a concrete term [t]. 
    
    Contrary to [wp t Q], with [wpgen t Q] one can carry out practical 
    reasoning on a concrete term [t]:

    - without having to manually invoke the reasoning rules such as [wp_seq],
    - without having to manipulate the concrete syntax (AST) of the term [t],
    - without having to manually simplify substitutions of the form [subst x v t1].

    The matter of the present chapter is to show:

    - how to define [wpgen t Q] as a recursive function that computes in Coq,
    - how to integrate support for the frame rule in this recursive definition,
    - how to carry out practical proofs using [wpgen t Q].

    A bonus section explains how to establish the soundness theorem for [wpgen].

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Definition of [wpgen] for term rules *)

(** [wpgen] computes a heap predicate that has the same meaning as [wp].
    In essence, [wpgen] takes the form of a recursive function that,
    like [wp], expects a term [t] and a postcondition [Q], and produces
    a heap predicate. The function is recursively defined and its result
    is guided by the structure of the term [t].
    
    Thus, in essence, the definition of [wpgen] admits the following shape:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => ..
      | trm_seq t1 t2 => ..
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => ..
      | trm_var x => ..
      | trm_app t1 t2 => ..
      | trm_fun x t1 => ..
      | trm_fix f x t1 => ..
      | trm_if v0 t1 t2 => ..
      end).
]]

    Our first goal is to fill in the dots for each of the term constructors.

    The intention that guides us for filling the dot is the soundness theorem
    for [wpgen], which takes the following form:
    
[[
    wpgen t Q ==> wp t Q
]]

    This entailement asserts in particular that if we are able to establish 
    [H ==> wpgen t Q], then we have proved [H ==> wp t Q], and thus also
    proved [triple t H Q].

    Remark: the main difference between [wpgen] and a "traditional" weakest 
    precondition generator (as the reader might have seen for Hoare logic)
    is that here we compute the weakest precondition of a raw term,
    not annotated with any invariant or specification.

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for values *)

(** Consider first the case of a value [v]. Recall the reasoning
    rule for values in weakest-precondition style. *)

Parameter wp_val : forall v Q,
  Q v ==> wp (trm_val v) Q.

(** The soundness theorem requires us to have:
    [wpgen (trm_val v) Q ==> wp (trm_val v) Q].
    To satisfy this entailement, it suffices to define [wpgen (trm_val v) Q] 
    as [Q v]. 

    Concretely, we fill in the first dots as follows:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => Q v
      ...
]]

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for functions *)

(** Consider the case of a function definition [trm_fun x t].
    Recall that the [wp] reasoning rule for functions is very similar 
    to that for values: *)

Parameter wp_fun : forall x t1 Q,
  Q (val_fun x t1) ==> wp (trm_fun x t1) Q.

(** So, likewise, we can define [wpgen] for functions and for
    recursive functions as follows:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_fun x t1   => Q (val_fun x t1)
      | trm_fix f x t1 => Q (val_fix f x t1)
      ...
]]

*)

(** An important observation is that we here do not attempt to 
    to recursively compute [wpgen] over the body of the function.
    This is something that we could do, and that we will see how
    to achiever further on, but postpone it for now because it is
    relatively technical. In practice, if the program feature a 
    local function definition, the user can easily request the 
    computation of [wpgen] over the body of that function. Thus,
    the fact that we do not recursively traverse functions bodies
    does not harm expressivity. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for sequence *)

(** Recall the [wp] reasoning rule for a sequence [trm_seq t1 t2]: *)

Parameter wp_seq : forall t1 t2 Q,
  wp t1 (fun v => wp t2 Q) ==> wp (trm_seq t1 t2) Q.

(** The intention is for [wpgen] to admit the same semantics as [wp].
    For this reason, we define [wpgen (trm_seq t1 t2) Q] as
    [wpgen t1 (fun r => wpgen t2 Q)].

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_seq t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen t2 Q)
      ...
]]

*)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for let-bindings *)

(** The case of let bindings is similar to that of sequences, 
    yet it involves a substitution. Recall the [wp] rule: *)

Parameter wp_let : forall x t1 t2 Q,
  wp t1 (fun v => wp (subst x v t2) Q) ==> wp (trm_let x t1 t2) Q.

(** We thus fill in the dots as follows:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen (subst x v t2) Q)
      ...
]]

    One important observation to make at this point is that the 
    function [wpgen] is no longer structurally recursive. 
    While the first recursive call to [wpgen] is invoked on [t1], which
    is a strict subterm of [t], the second call is invoked on [subst x v t2],
    which is not a strict subterm of [t].

    We'll come back later to the issue later and explain how it is possible:
    - either to convince Coq that the function [wpgen] nevertheless terminates,
    - or to circumvent the problem by adding as argument to [wpgen] a substitution 
      context that avoids computing substitution before making recursive calls.

*)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for variables *)

(** There are no reasoning rule that concludes [H ==> wp (trm_var x) Q]
    of [triple (trm_var x) H Q]. Indeed, [trm_var x] is a stuck term.

    While a term may feature variables, all these variables should have
    been substituted away before we reach them, through substitutions
    such as the one described above in the treatment of let-bindings.
    If a variable is reached, it means that it is a dandling free 
    variable, and that the program is broken. 
    
    Although there are no rules to introduce [wp (trm_var x) Q], we 
    nevertheless need to provide some meaningful definition for 
    [wpgen (trm_var x) Q]. This definition should capture the fact
    that this case must not happen. The predicate [\[False]] captures
    this well.

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_var x => \[False]
      ...
]]

*)

(** Remark: this definition suggests that, in fact, we could technically
    have stated a Separation Logic rule free variables, using [False]
    as a premise. *)

Lemma triple_var : forall x H Q,
  False ->
  triple (trm_var x) H Q.
Proof using. intros. false. Qed.

(** Likewise, a [wp] reasoning rule with [\[False]] as precondition
    would be technically correct, albeit totally useless. *)

Lemma wp_var : forall x Q,
  \[False] ==> wp (trm_var x) Q.
Proof using. intros. intros h Hh. destruct (hpure_inv Hh). false. Qed.


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for function applications *)

(** Consider an application in A-normal form, that is,  
    an application of the form [trm_app v1 v2].
    
    We have [wp]-style rules to reason about the application of
    a known function, e.g. [trm_app (val_fun x t1) v2].
    However, if [v1] is an abstrat value (e.g., a Coq variable
    of type [var]), we have no specific reasoning rule at hand.

    Thus, we will simply define [wpgen (trm_app v1 v2) Q] as
    [wp (trm_app v1 v2) Q]. In other words, we fall back to the
    semantic definition of [wp].

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_app v1 v2 => wp (trm_app v1 v2) Q
      ...
]]

    As we carry out verification proofs in practice, when reaching
    an application we will face a goal of the form:
[[
    H ==> wpgen (trm_app v1 v2) Q
]]
    By revealing the definition of [wpgen] on applications, we get:
[[
    H ==> wp (trm_app v1 v2) Q
]]
    Then by exploiting the equivalence with triples, we get:
[[
    triple (trm_app v1 v2) H Q
]]
    which can be proved by invoking a specification triple for 
    the function [v1].

    In other words, we falling back to the semantics definition
    when reaching a function application, we allow the user to choose 
    which specification lemma to exploit for reasoning about this 
    particular function application. Remark: with some degree of tactic 
    automation, we will avoid the user having to explicitly provide
    the name of the specification lemma, as this would be cumbersome.

*)

(** Remark: we assume throughout the course that terms are written 
    in A-normal form. Nevertheless, we need to define [wpgen] even
    on terms that are not in A-normal form. One possibility is
    to map all these terms to [\[False]]. In the specific case of an
    application of the form [trm_app t1 t2] where [t1] and [t2] are
    not both values, it is still correct to define [wpgen (trm_app t1 t2))
    as [wp (trm_app t1 t2)]. So, we need not bother checking here
    that the arguments of [trm_app] are actually values.

    Thus, the most concise definition for [wpgen] on applications is:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_app t1 t2 => wp t Q
      ...
]]

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for conditionals *)

(** The last remaining case is that for conditionals.
    Recall the [wp]-style reasoning rule stated using 
    a Coq conditional. *)

Parameter wp_if : forall (b:bool) t1 t2 Q,
  (if b then (wp t1 Q) else (wp t2 Q)) ==> wp (trm_if b t1 t2) Q.

(** The statement above actually features hidden coercions.
    The right-hand side of the entailment only applies to a term 
    of the form [trm_if (trm_val (val_bool b)) t1 t2].

    Yet, we need to define [wpgen] for all conditionals in A-normal
    form, i.e., all terms of the form [trm_if (trm_val v0) t1 t2], where
    [v0] could a value of unknown shape. Typically, a program may feature
    a conditional [trm_if (trm_var x) t1 t2] that, after substitution
    for [x], becomes [trm_if (trm_val v) t1 t2], for some abstract
    [v] of type [val] that might not yet be know to be a boolean value.

    To handle the problem, we pattern match [t] as [trm_if t0 t1 t2],
    and define its [wpgen] as a heap predicate that requires the 
    existence of a boolean [b] such that [t0 = trm_val (val_bool b)]. 
    This way, we delay the moment at which the argument of the conditional
    needs to be shown to be a boolean value. The formal definition is:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_if t0 t1 t2 =>
          \exists (b:bool), \[t0 = trm_val (val_bool b)]
            \* (if b then (wpgen t1) Q else (wpgen t2) Q)
      ...
]] 

*)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Summary of the definition of [wpgen] for term rules *)

(** In summary, we have defined:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => Q v
      | trm_fun x t1 => Q (val_fun x t)
      | trm_fix f x t1 => Q (val_fix f x t)
      | trm_seq t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen t2 Q)
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen (subst x v t2) Q)
      | trm_var x => \[False]
      | trm_app v1 v2 => wp t Q
      | trm_if t0 t1 t2 =>
          \exists (b:bool), \[t0 = trm_val (val_bool b)]
            \* (if b then (wpgen t1) Q else (wpgen t2) Q)
      end.
]]

    This definition accounts for the reasoning rules for terms.

    However, this definition lacks support for conveniently exploiting
    the structural rules of the logic. We are going to fix this next.
*)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Extension of [wpgen] to handle structural rules *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Introduction of [mkstruct] in the definition of [wpgen] *)

(** Recall from the previous chapter the statement of the 
    frame rule in [wp]-style. *)

Parameter wp_frame : forall t H Q,
  (wp t Q) \* H ==> wp t (Q \*+ H).

(** We would like [wpgen] to satisfy the same rule, so that we can
    exploit the frame rule while reasoning about a program using
    the heap predicate produced by [wpgen]. 
    
    With the definition of [wpgen] set up so far, it is possible
    to prove, for any concrete term [t], that the frame property
    [(wpgen t Q) \* H ==> wpgen t (Q \*+ H)] holds.
    However, establishing this result requires an induction over
    the entire structure of the term [t]---a lot of tedious work.

    Instead, we are going to tweak the definition of [wpgen] so as to
    produce, at every step of the recursion, a special token to capture
    the property that "whatever the details of the output predicate 
    produced, it does satisfy the frame property". *)

(** We achieve this magic in three steps. First, we rewrite the 
    prototype of the function [wpgen] so as to make it explicitly
    a function of the postcondition [Q].

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) : (val->hprop)->hprop :=
      fun (Q:val->hprop) =>   
        match t with
        | trm_val v => Q v
        | .. => ..
        end.

]]

    Second, we introduce a predicate called [mkstruct], and insert 
    it at the head of the output produced by [wpgen] (and all of 
    its recursive invokation) as follows:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) : (val->hprop)->hprop :=
      mkstruct (
        fun (Q:val->hprop) =>   
          match t with
          | trm_val v => Q v
          | .. => ..
          end).
]]

    The interest of the insertion of [mkstruct] above is that every result 
    of a computation of [wpgen t] on a concrete term [t] is, by construction, 
    of the form [mkstruct F] for some argument [F].

    Third, to enable the function [wpgen] to compute well in Coq,
    we need to swap the [fun Q] with the [match t], so that the
    pattern matching on [t] is visible enough for Coq to simplify it.

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) : (val->hprop)->hprop :=
      mkstruct (
        match t with
        | trm_val v => (fun Q => Q v)
        | .. => (fun Q => ..)
        end).
]]

    There remains to investigate how [mkstruct] should be defined. 
*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Properties of [mkstruct] *)

(** Before we state the properties that [mkstruct] should satisfy,
    let us first figure out the type of [mkstruct].
    
    The type of [wpgen t] is [(val->hprop)->hprop].
    Thereafter, let [formula] be a shorthand for this type. *)

Definition formula : Type := (val->hprop)->hprop.

(** Because [mkstruct] appears between the prototype and the 
    [match] in the body of [wpgen], the predicate [mkstruct]
    has type [formula->formula]. *)

Parameter mkstruct : formula->formula.

(** There remains to find a suitable definition for [mkstruct] that enables
    the frame property and the consequence property. These properties can
    be stated by mimicking the rules [wp_frame] and [wp_conseq]. *)

Parameter mkstruct_frame : forall (F:formula) H Q,
  (mkstruct F Q) \* H ==> mkstruct F (Q \*+ H).

Parameter mkstruct_conseq : forall (F:formula) Q1 Q2,
  Q1 ===> Q2 ->
  mkstruct F Q1 ==> mkstruct F Q2.

(** In addition, it should be possible to erase [mkstruct] from the head
    of the output produced [wpgen t] when we do not need to apply any 
    structural rule. In other words, we need to be able to prove 
    [H ==> mkstruct F Q] by proving [H ==> F Q], for any [H]. 
    This erasure property is captured by the following entailment. *)

Parameter mkstruct_erase : forall (F:formula) Q,
  F Q ==> mkstruct F Q.


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Realization of [mkstruct] *)

(** Fortunately, it turns out that there exists a predicate [mkstruct] satisfying 
    the three required properties. Let us pull out of our hat a definition that works. *)

Module MkstructRealize.

Definition mkstruct (F:formula) : formula := 
  fun (Q:val->hprop) => \exists Q1 H, F Q1 \* H \* \[Q1 \*+ H ===> Q].

(** We postpone to a bonus section the discussion of why it works and of how 
    one could have guessed this definition. Again, it really does not matter 
    the details of the definition, as long as it satisfies the three required 
    properties: [mkstruct_frame], [mkstruct_conseq], and [mkstruct_erase],
    as established below. *)

Lemma mkstruct_frame : forall (F:formula) H Q,
  (mkstruct F Q) \* H ==> mkstruct F (Q \*+ H).
Proof using. 
  intros. unfold mkstruct. xpull ;=> Q' H' M. xsimpl. xchange M.
Qed.

Lemma mkstruct_conseq : forall (F:formula) Q1 Q2,
  Q1 ===> Q2 ->
  mkstruct F Q1 ==> mkstruct F Q2.
Proof using.
  introv WQ. unfold mkstruct. xpull ;=> Q' H' M. xsimpl. xchange M. xchange WQ.
 Qed.

Lemma mkstruct_erase : forall (F:formula) Q,
  F Q ==> mkstruct F Q.
Proof using. intros. unfold mkstruct. xsimpl. xsimpl. Qed.

End MkstructRealize.


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Computating with [wpgen] *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** A structurally recursive version of [wpgen] *)

(** Consider the current proposal for [wpgen].

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) : formula :=
      mkstruct (match t with
      | trm_val v => fun Q => Q v
      | trm_fun x t1 => fun Q => Q (val_fun x t)
      | trm_fix f x t1 => fun Q => Q (val_fix f x t)
      | trm_seq t1 t2 => fun Q => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen t2 Q)
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => fun Q => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen (subst x v t2) Q)
      | trm_var x => fun Q => \[False]
      | trm_app v1 v2 => fun Q => wp t Q
      | trm_if t0 t1 t2 => fun Q => 
          \exists (b:bool), \[t0 = trm_val (val_bool b)]
            \* (if b then (wpgen t1) Q else (wpgen t2) Q)
      end).
]]

    This definition is not accepted by Coq because, as mentioned earlier,
    it is not structurally recursive, due to the recursive call 
    [wpgen (subst x v t2)]. 
    
    The problem is associated with the substitution. The fix that we
    consider next consists in delaying the substitutions until the
    end of the recursive calls.
    
    Concretely, we modify the function to take the form [wpgen E t], 
    where [E] denotes a set of bindings from variables to values. 
    The intention is that [wpgen E t] computes the weakest precondition
    for the term [isubst E t], which denotes the result of substituting
    all bindings from E inside the term [t]. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of contexts and operations on them *)

(** The simplest way to define a context [E] is as an association 
    list relating variables to values. *)

Definition ctx : Type := list (var*val).

(** Before we present how the introduction of a context impacts 
    the definition of [wpgen], we need to formalize the "iterated
    substitution" operation, written [isubst E t]. The definition
    is relatively standard: the substitution traverses the term
    recursively and, when reaching a variable, performs a lookup
    in the term [E]. 
    
    The definition of the [lookup] operation on association lists
    is standard. *)

Fixpoint lookup (x:var) (E:ctx) : option val :=
  match E with
  | nil => None
  | (y,v)::E1 => if var_eq x y
                   then Some v
                   else lookup x E1
  end.

(** One additional technicality is the need to respect variable shadowing,
    which imposes to remove bindings on a variable [x] when entering
    through the scope of a bound variable named [x]. The removal operation 
    on a context represented as an association list is also standard. *)

Fixpoint rem (x:var) (E:ctx) : ctx :=
  match E with
  | nil => nil
  | (y,v)::E1 =>
      let E1' := rem x E1 in
      if var_eq x y then E1' else (y,v)::E1'
  end.

(* The definition of the operation [isubst] can then be expressed as a 
   recursive function over the term [t]. *)

Fixpoint isubst (E:ctx) (t:trm) : trm :=
  match t with
  | trm_val v =>
       v
  | trm_var x =>
       match lookup x E with
       | None => t
       | Some v => v
       end
  | trm_fun x t1 =>
       trm_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1)
  | trm_fix f x t1 =>
       trm_fix f x (isubst (rem x (rem f E)) t1)
  | trm_app t1 t2 =>
       trm_app (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)
  | trm_seq t1 t2 =>
       trm_seq (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)
  | trm_let x t1 t2 =>
       trm_let x (isubst E t1) (isubst (rem x E) t2)
  | trm_if t0 t1 t2 =>
       trm_if (isubst E t0) (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)
  end.

(** Remark: it would be also possible to define the substitution by
    iterating the unary substitution [subst] over the list of bindings
    from [E], however doing so is much less efficient and would

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [wpgen]: the let-binding case *)

(** When [wpgen] traverses a let-binding, rather than eargerly 
    performing a substitution, it simply extends the current context.
    Concretely, a call to [wpgen E (trm_let x t1 t2)] triggers a recursive 
    call to [wpgen ((x,v)::E) t2]. The corresponding definition is:

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct (match t with
      ...
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => fun Q => 
           (wpgen E t1) (fun v => wpgen ((x,v)::E) t2)
      ...
      ) end.
]]

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [wpgen]: the variable case *)

(** When [wpgen] reaches a variable, it lookups for a binding 
    on the variable [x] inside the context [E]. Concretely, the evaluation
    of [wpgen E (trm_var x)] triggers a call to [lookup x E]. 

    If the context [E] binds the variable [x] to some value [v], then
    the operation [lookup x E] returns [Some v]. In that case, 
    [wpgen] returns the weakest precondition for that value [v], 
    that is, [Q v].

    Otherwise, if [E] does not bind [x], the lookup operation returns [None].
    In that case, [wpgen] returns [\[False]], which we have explained to be
    the weakest precondition for a stuck program.

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct (match t with
      ...
      | trm_var x => fun Q => 
           match lookup x E with
           | Some v => Q v
           | None => \[False]
           end
      ...
      ) end.
]]

----TODO: essayer  lookup swap with fun Q.
*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [wpgen]: the application case *)

(** In the previous definition of [wpgen] with contexts, the argued
    that the result of [wpgen t Q] in the case where [t] is an application
    should be simply [wp t Q]. In other words, we resort to the semantics
    interpretation for an application.

    In the definition of [wpgen] with contexts, the intepretation of
    [wpgen E t] is the weakest precondition of the term [isubst E t],
    which denotes the result of substituting variables from [E] in [t].

    When [t] is an application, we thus define [wpgen E t] as the formula
    [fun Q => wp (isubst E t) Q], or simply [wp (isubst E t)] by eliminating
    the useless eta-expansion.

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct (match t with
      ...
      | trm_app v1 v2 => wp (isubst E t)
      ..
]]

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [wpgen]: the function definition case *)

(** Consider the case where [t] is a function definition, for example  
    [trm_fun x t1]. The formula [wpgen E t] is interpreted as the weakest
    precondition of [isubst E t].
    
    By unfolding the definition of [isubst] in the case where [t] is 
    [trm_fun x t1], we obtain [trm_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1)].

    The weakest precondition for that value is 
    [fun Q => Q (val_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1))].
    Thus, [wpgen E t] handles functions, and recursive functions, as follows:

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct (match t with
      ...
      | trm_fun x t1 => fun Q => Q (val_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1))
      | trm_fix f x t1 => fun Q => Q (val_fix f x (isubst (rem x (rem f E)) t1))
      ...
      ) end.
]]

*)

(** *** [wpgen]: at last, an executable function *)

Module WpgenExec1.

(** At last, we arrive to a definition of [wpgen] that typechecks in Coq,
    and that can be used to effectively compute weakest preconditions in
    Separation Logic. *)

Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
  mkstruct (match t with
  | trm_val v => fun Q => Q v
  | trm_fun x t1 => fun Q => Q (val_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1))
  | trm_fix f x t1 => fun Q => Q (val_fix f x (isubst (rem x (rem f E)) t1))
  | trm_seq t1 t2 => fun Q => wpgen E t1 (fun v => wpgen E t2 Q)
  | trm_let x t1 t2 => fun Q => wpgen E t1 (fun v => wpgen ((x,v)::E) t2 Q)
  | trm_var x => fun Q =>
       match lookup x E with

        \* (if b then (wpgen E t1) Q else (wpgen E t2) Q)
  end).

(** Compared with the presentation using the form [wpgen t], the 
    new presentation using the form [wpgen E t] has the main benefits
    that it is structurally recursive, thus easy to define in Coq.
    Moreover, it is algorithmically more efficient in general, because 
    it performs substitutions easily rather than eagerly. *)

(** *** Intermediate definitions for [wpgen]: case of sequences *)

(** We reformulate the definition of [wpgen E t] by introducing
    intermediate definitions, one per term construct. For each
    of these intermediate definition, we introduce an ad-hoc 
    notation that enables displaying the [wpgen] of a term [t] in
    a way that resembles the source code of [t]. *)

(** Consider for example the case of a sequence. The definition
    of [wpgen E (trm_seq t1 t2)] is [fun Q => wpgen E t1 (fun v => wpgen E t2 Q)].
    Let [F1] and [F2] denote the results of the recursive calls,
    [wpgen E t1] and [wpgen E t2], respectively.
    Then [wpgen E (trm_seq t1 t2)] reformulates as [fun Q => F1 (fun v => F2 Q)].

    We introduce definition a combinator named [wpgen_seq F1 F2] to capture
    the logic of [fun Q => F1 (fun v => F2 Q)], in such a way that
    [wgpen E (trm_seq t1 t2)] can be defined as [wp_seq (wpgen E t1) (wpgen E t2)]. *)

Definition wpgen_seq (F1 F2:formula) : formula := fun Q =>
  F1 (fun v => F2 Q).

(** The definition of [wpgen E t] may then be rewritten as follows:

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct (match t with
    ...
    | trm_seq t1 t2 => wpgen_seq (wpgen E t1) (wpgen E t2 Q)
    ... 
    end).
]]
*)

(** Next, we introduce a piece of notation so as to display any formula 
    of the form [wpgen_seq F1 F2] as [Seq F1 '; F2 ].  *)

Notation "'Seq' F1 '; F2" :=
  ((wpgen_seq F1 F2))
  (at level 68, right associativity,
   format "'[v' 'Seq'  '[' F1 ']'  '';'  '/'  '[' F2 ']' ']'").

(** Thanks to this notation, the [wpgen] of a sequence [t1 '; t2] displays as 
    [Seq F1 '; F2] where [F1] and [F2] denote the [wpgen] of [t1] and [t2],
    respectively. *)
    
(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Intermediate definitions for [wpgen]: other constructs *)

(** By generalizing this approach to every term constructs, we obtain the
    property that the [wpgen] of a term [t] displays "pretty much" like
    the source term [t] itself---up to alpha-renaming of local variables. 
    
    The other definitions are stated below. It is not required to understand
    all the details from this subsection. *)

(** * Soundness proof for [wpgen] *)

Module WPgenSound.


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Statement of soundness *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Introduction of the predicate [formula_sound] *)

(** The soundness theorem that we aim to establish for [wpgen] is: *)

Parameter wpgen_sound : forall E t Q,
  wpgen E t Q ==> wp (isubst E t) Q.

(** Before we enter the details of the proof, let us reformulate the 
    soundness statement of the soundness theorem in a way that will 
    make proof obligations and induction hypotheses easier to read. 
    To that end, we introduce the predicate [formula_sound t F],
    which asserts that [F] is a weakest-precondition style formula 
    that entails [wp t]. Formally: *)

Definition formula_sound (t:trm) (F:formula) : Prop :=
  forall Q, F Q ==> wp t Q.

(** Using [formula_sound], the soundness theorem reformulates as: *)

Parameter wpgen_sound' : forall E t,
  formula_sound (isubst E t) (wpgen t).


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Soundness for the case of sequences *)

(** Let us forget about the existence of [mkstruct] for a minute,
    that is, pretend that [wpgen] is defined without [mkstruct].

    In that setting, [wpgen E (trm_seq t1 t2)] evaluates to
    [wpgen_seq (wpgen E t1) (wpgen E t2)]. 

    Recall the definition of [wpgen_seq]:

[[
  Definition wpgen_seq (F1 F2:formula) : formula := fun Q =>
    F1 (fun v => F2 Q).
]]

*)

(** Consider the soundness theorem [wpgen_sound'] and in the 
    particular case where [t] is of the form [trm_seq t1 t2].
    The corresponding statement is: *)

Parameter wpgen_sound_seq : forall E t1 t2,
  formula_sound (isubst E (trm_seq t1 t2)) (wpgen (trm_seq t1 t2)).

(** In that statement:
    
    - [wpgen E (trm_seq t1 t2)] evaluates to
      [wpgen_seq (wpgen E t1) (wpgen E t2)].
    - [isubst E (trm_seq t1 t2)] evaluates to
      [trm_seq (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)]. 
    
    Moreover, by induction hypothesis, we will be able to assume
    the soundness result to already hold for the subterms [t1] and [t2].
    
    Thus, to establish the soundness of [wpgen] for sequences, we 
    have to prove the following result: *)

Parameter wpgen_sound_seq' : forall E t1 t2,
  formula_sound (isubst E t1) (wpgen t1) ->
  formula_sound (isubst E t2) (wpgen t2) ->
  formula_sound (trm_seq (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)) 
                (wpgen_seq (wpgen E t1) (wpgen E t2)).

(** In the above, let us abstract [isubst E t1] as [t1'] and 
    [wpgen t1] as [F1], and similarly [isubst E t2] as [t2'] 
    and [wpgen t2] as [F2]. We obtain: *)

  formula_sound t1' F1 ->
  formula_sound t2' F2 ->

    Consider a term [t]. The result of [wpgen t] takes the form
    [mkstruct F], where [F] denotes the main pattern matching 
    on [t] that occurs in the definition of [wpgen].
    
    Our goal is to show that if the formula [F] is a valid
    weakest precondition for [t], then so is [mkstruct F].
    Formally: *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Lemmas capturing properties of iterated substitutions *)

(** In the proof of soundness for [wpgen], we need to exploit two 
    basic properties of the iterated substitution function [isubst].
    
    The first property asserts that the substitution for the empty 
    context is the identity. This result is needed to cleanly state
    the final statement of the soundness theorem. *)

Parameter isubst_nil : forall t,
  isubst nil t = t.

(** The second property asserts that the substitution for a context
    [(x,v)::E] is the same as the substitution for the context [rem x E]
    followed with the substitution of [x] by [v] using the basic
    substitution function [subst]. This second property is needed to
    handle the case of let-bindings. *)

Parameter isubst_rem : forall x v E t,
  isubst ((x,v)::E) t = subst x v (isubst (rem x E) t).

(** The proof of these lemmas is technical and of little interest.
    They can be found in appendix near the end of this chapter. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Main induction for the soundness proof of [wpgen] *)

(** We prove the soundness of [wpgen E t] by structural induction on [t].

    As explaiend previously, the soundness lemma is stated with help
    of the predicate [formula_sound], in the form:
    [formula_sound (isubst E t) (wpgen t)].

    For each term construct, the proof case consists of two steps: 
    
    - first, invoke the lemma [mkstruct_sound] to justify soundness 
      of the leading [mkstruct] produced by [wpgen],
    - second, invoke the the soundness lemma specific to that term 
      construct, e.g. [wpgen_seq_sound] for sequences.

Module MkstructGuess.

(** How could we have possibly guessed the definition of [mkstruct]?

    This predicate should satisfy the three properties:
    [mkstruct_frame], [mkstruct_conseq] and [mkstruct_erase].

    Recall the property [mkstruct_conseq]: *)

Parameter mkstruct_conseq : forall F Q1 Q2,
  Q1 ===> Q2 ->
  mkstruct F Q1 ==> mkstruct F Q2.

(** Let us reformulate this as an introduction rule for [mkstruct]. *)

Parameter mkstruct_conseq' : forall F Q2,
  \exists Q1, \[Q1 ===> Q2]Â \* (mkstruct F Q1) ==> mkstruct F Q2.

(** From there, it would tempting to define [mkstruct F Q2] as
    [\exists Q1, \[Q1 ===> Q2]Â \* (mkstruct F Q1)]. 
    Yet, this definition of [mkstruct] is circular: it refers to itself. 
    Let's overcome the circularity in a radical manner, by getting rid
    of the occurence of [mkstruct] inside its definition. 

    Doing so, it turns out, leads to a definition that does satisfy
    the property [mkstruct_conseq] as required. *)

Definition mkstruct1 (F:formula) : formula := 
  fun (Q2:val->hprop) => \exists Q1, F Q1 \* \[Q1 ===> Q2].

Lemma mkstruct1_conseq : forall F Q1 Q2,
  Q1 ===> Q2 ->
  mkstruct1 F Q1 ==> mkstruct1 F Q2.
Proof using. introv M. unfolds mkstruct1. xsimpl. Qed.

(** The second task is to extend the definition in order to also support
    not just [mkstruct_conseq], but also [mkstruct_frame]. *)

Parameter mkstruct_frame : forall F H Q,
  (mkstruct F Q) \* H ==> mkstruct F (Q \*+ H).

(** Taking inspiration from the rule [wp_conseq_frame] which combines
    the frame rule and the rule of consequence into a single rule, we
    can state a property of [mkstruct] that captures at once the two
    required properties. *)

Parameter mkstruct_conseq_frame : forall F Q1 Q2 H,
  Q1 \*+ H ===> Q2 ->
  H \* (mkstruct F Q1) ==> mkstruct F (Q2 \*+ H).

(** Again, let us reformulate this as an introduction rule for [mkstruct]. *)

Parameter mkstruct_conseq' : forall F Q2,
  \exists Q1 H, \[Q1 \*+ H ===> Q2]Â \* H \* (mkstruct F Q1) ==> mkstruct F Q2.

(** Again, eliminating the reference to [mkstruct] on the left-hand side of
    the entailment suggests the following definition. *)

Definition mkstruct (F:formula) : formula := 
  fun (Q2:val->hprop) => \exists Q1 H, F Q1 \* H \* \[Q1 \*+ H ===> Q2].

(** As we have proved earlier in this chapter, this definition indeed satisfies
    all the required properties. In particular, recall [mkstruct_erase]: *)

Parameter mkstruct_erase : forall (F:formula) Q,
  F Q ==> mkstruct F Q.

(** To prove it, instantiate [Q2] from the definition of [mkstruct]Â as [Q],
    and [H]Â as the empty heap predicate. *)

(** Remark: an interesting property of [mkstruct] is its idempotence:
    [mkstruct (mkstruct F) = mkstruct F].

    Idempotence asserts that applying the predicate [mkstruct] more than 
    once does provide more expressiveness than applying it just once. 

    Intuitively, idempotence reflects in particular the fact that two nested 
    applications of the rule of consequence can always be combined into a 
    single application of that rule (due to the transitivity of entailement) 
    and that, similarly, two nested applications of the frame rule can always 
    be combined into a single application of that rule (framing onÂ [H1] then 
    framing on [H2] is equivalent to framing on [H1 \* H2]). *)
