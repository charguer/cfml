(** * The chapter in a rush *)

(** In the previous chapter, we have introduced a predicate called [wp]
    to describe the weakest precondition of a term [t] with respect to
    a given postcondition [Q]. The weakest precondition [wp] is defined
    by the equivalence [H ==> wp t Q] if and only if [triple t H Q].

    This definition gives a "semantics" to [wp], for which reasoning
    rules can be proved. For example, [wp (trm_seq t1 t2) Q] is
    entailed by [wp t1 (fun r => wp t2 Q)], as captured by lemma [wp_seq].

    In this chapter, we introduce a function to "compute" [wpgen t Q]
    recursively over the structure of the term [t]. For example,
    [wpgen t Q] is essentially defined as [wpgen t1 (fun r => wpgen t2 Q)].

    The intention is for [wpgen t Q] to recursively construct a heap predicate
    that has the same interpretation [wp t Q], but that can be directly
    used for interactive reasoning about a concrete term [t].

    The predicate [wpgen t Q] enables convenient interactive reasoning
    about a concrete term [t]. Contrary to [wp t Q], the manipulation of
    [wpgen t Q]:

    - does not require manipulating the concrete syntax (AST) of the term [t],
    - does not require manipulating substitutions of the form [subst x v t1],
    - does not require manual invokation of the reasoning rules such as [wp_seq],
      because these rules are "pre-applied" in the formula [wpgen t Q].

    The matter of the present chapter is to show:

    - how to define [wpgen t Q] as a recursive function that computes in Coq,
    - how to integrate support for the frame rule in this recursive definition,
    - how to carry out practical proofs using [wpgen t Q].

    A bonus section explains how to establish the soundness theorem for [wpgen].

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Summary *)

(** The "chapter in a rush" overview that comes next is fairly short.
    It only gives a bird-eye tour of the steps of the construction.
    All the explanations are provided in the main body of the chapter. *)

(** At first, [wpgen t Q] is presented as a recursive function
    that pattern matches on its argument [t] and produces the
    appropriate heap predicate in each case.

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => Q v
      | trm_var x => \[False]
      | trm_app v1 v2 => wp t Q
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen (subst x v t2) Q)
      ...
      end.
]]

    In a second step, the definition is modified to make it structurally
    recursive. It is changed to the form [wpgen E t Q], where [E] denotes
    an association list bindings values to variables. The intention is that
    [wpgen E t Q] computes the weakest precondition for [isubst E t], which
    is the result of substituting bindings from [E] inside [t].

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => Q v
      | trm_var x =>
           match lookup x E with
           | Some v => Q v
           | None => \[False]
           end
      | trm_app v1 v2 => wp (isubst E t) Q
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => wpgen E t1 (fun v => wpgen ((x,v)::E) t2 Q)
      ...
      end.
]]

    In a third step, the argument [Q] is moved below the [match t with].
    The type of [wpgen E t] is [(val->hprop)->hprop], which is abbreviated
    as [formula].

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v =>  fun (Q:val->hprop) => Q v
      | trm_var x =>  fun (Q:val->hprop) =>
           match lookup x E with
           | Some v => Q v
           | None => \[False]
           end
      | trm_app v1 v2 => fun (Q:val->hprop) =>  wp (isubst E t) Q
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => fun (Q:val->hprop) =>
                              wpgen E t1 (fun v => wpgen ((x,v)::E) t2 Q)
      ...
      end.
]]

    In a fourth step, auxiliary definitions, e.g. [wpgen_val], [wpgen_var],
    are [wpgen_let] are introduced, to improve the readability of the output.

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => wpgen_val v
      | trm_var x => wpgen_var E x
      | trm_app t1 t2 => wp (isubst E t)
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => wpgen_let (wpgen E t1) (fun v => wpgen ((x,v)::E) t2)
      ...
      end.
]]

    For example, [wpgen_let] is defined as:

[[
    Definition wpgen_let (F1:formula) (F2of:val->formula) : formula := fun Q =>
      F1 (fun v => F2of v Q).
]]

    And this definition comes with a custom notation:

[[
    Notation "'Let'' x ':=' F1 'in' F2" :=
      ((wpgen_let F1 (fun x => F2))).
]]

    The result of invoking [wpgen] on a let-binding is a formula that displays
    in the form [Let' x := F1 in F2], where [F1] and [F2] denote the result of
    [wpgen] for the subterms of that let-binding.


    In a fifth step, a predicate [mkstruct] is inserted at the head of the
    output of [wpgen] (and of all its recursive invokation), to enable capturing
    the structural rules of the logic.

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
      mkstruct (match t with
                | trm_val v => ...
                | ...
                end).
]]

    In a sixth step, tactics are introduced to manipulate the elements from
    the output of [wpgen]. For example, [xstruct_lemma] enables dropping
    [mkstruct] when it is not needed, and [xlet_lemma] reveals the definition
    of [wpgen_let]. These lemmas are exploited by the implementation of the
    x-tactics, for example [xlet].

[[

    Lemma xstruct_lemma : forall F H Q,
      H ==> F Q ->
      H ==> mkstruct F Q.

    Lemma xlet_lemma : forall H F1 F2of Q,
      H ==> F1 (fun v => F2of v Q) ->
      H ==> mkstruct (wpgen_let F1 F2of Q).

    Tactic Notation "xlet" :=
      applys xstruct_lemma; applys xlet_lemma.
]]

    The benefits of using the x-tactics is well illustrated by the demo
    contained in this file. Search for the tag "THE_DEMO" in this file,
    and contemplate the proof scripts at that location.

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Definition of [wpgen] for term rules *)

(** [wpgen] computes a heap predicate that has the same meaning as [wp].
    In essence, [wpgen] takes the form of a recursive function that,
    like [wp], expects a term [t] and a postcondition [Q], and produces
    a heap predicate. The function is recursively defined and its result
    is guided by the structure of the term [t].

    In essence, the definition of [wpgen] admits the following shape:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => ..
      | trm_seq t1 t2 => ..
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => ..
      | trm_var x => ..
      | trm_app t1 t2 => ..
      | trm_fun x t1 => ..
      | trm_fix f x t1 => ..
      | trm_if v0 t1 t2 => ..
      end).
]]

    Our first target is to figure out how to fill in the dots for each of the
    term constructors.

    The intention that guides us for filling the dot is the soundness theorem
    for [wpgen], which takes the following form:

[[
    wpgen t Q ==> wp t Q
]]

    This entailement asserts in particular that, if we are able to establish
    a statement of the form [H ==> wpgen t Q], then we can derive from it
    [H ==> wp t Q]. The latter is also equivalent to [triple t H Q].
    Thus, [wpgen] can be viewed as a practical tool to establish triples.

    Remark: the main difference between [wpgen] and a "traditional" weakest
    precondition generator (as the reader might have seen for Hoare logic)
    is that here we compute the weakest precondition of a raw term,
    not annotated with any invariant or specification.

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for values *)

(** Consider first the case of a value [v]. Recall the reasoning
    rule for values in weakest-precondition style. *)

Parameter wp_val : forall v Q,
  Q v ==> wp (trm_val v) Q.

(** The soundness theorem for [wpgen] requires us to have:
    [wpgen (trm_val v) Q ==> wp (trm_val v) Q].

    To satisfy this entailement, according to the rule [wp_val],
    it suffices to define [wpgen (trm_val v) Q] as [Q v].

    Concretely, we fill in the first dots as follows:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => Q v
      ...
]]

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for functions *)

(** Consider the case of a function definition [trm_fun x t].
    Recall that the [wp] reasoning rule for functions is very similar
    to that for values: *)

Parameter wp_fun : forall x t1 Q,
  Q (val_fun x t1) ==> wp (trm_fun x t1) Q.

(** So, likewise, we can define [wpgen] for functions and for
    recursive functions as follows:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      ...
      | trm_fun x t1   => Q (val_fun x t1)
      | trm_fix f x t1 => Q (val_fix f x t1)
      ...
]]

*)

(** An important observation is that we here do not attempt to
    to recursively compute [wpgen] over the body of the function.
    This is something that we could do, and that we will see how
    to achiever further on, but postpone it for now because it is
    relatively technical. In practice, if the program feature a
    local function definition, the user can easily request the
    computation of [wpgen] over the body of that function. Thus,
    the fact that we do not recursively traverse functions bodies
    does not harm expressivity. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for sequence *)

(** Recall the [wp] reasoning rule for a sequence [trm_seq t1 t2]: *)

Parameter wp_seq : forall t1 t2 Q,
  wp t1 (fun v => wp t2 Q) ==> wp (trm_seq t1 t2) Q.

(** The intention is for [wpgen] to admit the same semantics as [wp].
    We thus expect the definition of [wpgen (trm_seq t1 t2) Q] to have a
    similar shape as [wp t1 (fun v => wp t2 Q)].

    We therefore define [wpgen (trm_seq t1 t2) Q] as
    [wpgen t1 (fun r => wpgen t2 Q)]. Concretely:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      ...
      | trm_seq t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen t2 Q)
      ...
]]

*)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for let-bindings *)

(** The case of let bindings is similar to that of sequences,
    yet it involves a substitution. Recall the [wp] rule: *)

Parameter wp_let : forall x t1 t2 Q,
  wp t1 (fun v => wp (subst x v t2) Q) ==> wp (trm_let x t1 t2) Q.

(** We fill in the dots as follows:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      ...
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen (subst x v t2) Q)
      ...
]]

    One important observation to make at this point is that the
    function [wpgen] is no longer structurally recursive. Indeed,
    while the first recursive call to [wpgen] is invoked on [t1], which
    is a strict subterm of [t], the second call is invoked on [subst x v t2],
    which is not a strict subterm of [t].

    It is possible to  convince Coq that the function [wpgen] nevertheless
    terminates, or, more simply, to circumvent the problem altogether by
    casting the function in a form that makes it structurally recursive.
    Concretely, we will see further on how to add as argument to [wpgen]
    a substitution context (written [E]) to delay the computation of
    substitutions until the leaves of the recursion. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for variables *)

(** There are no reasoning rules to establish a triple or a [wp]-entailment
    for a program variable. In other words, there are no rules to prove
    [triple (trm_var x) H Q] or prove concludes [H ==> wp (trm_var x) Q].
    Indeed, [trm_var x] is a stuck term---its execution does not produce
    an output.

    While a source term may contain program variables, all these variables
    should have been substituted away before the execution reaches them.
    In the case of the function [wpgen], the variables bound by a "let"
    get substituted while traversing the let-binding construct.
    If a free variable is reached by [wpgen], it means that this variable
    was a dandling free variable, and therefore that the initial source term
    was invalid.

    Although there are no rules to introduce [wp (trm_var x) Q], we
    nevertheless have to provide some meaningful definition for
    [wpgen (trm_var x) Q]. This definition should capture the fact
    that this case must not happen. The heap predicate [\[False]] captures
    this intention perfectly.

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      ...
      | trm_var x => \[False]
      ...
]]

*)

(** Remark: the definition of \[False] translates the fact that,
    technically, we could have stated a Separation Logic rule
    for free variables, using [False] as a premise, either as a triple: *)

Lemma triple_var : forall x H Q,
  False ->
  triple (trm_var x) H Q.
Proof using. intros. false. Qed.

(** or as a [wp]-entailemnt with [\[False]] as precondition: *)

Lemma wp_var : forall x Q,
  \[False] ==> wp (trm_var x) Q.
Proof using. intros. intros h Hh. destruct (hpure_inv Hh). false. Qed.

(** These two rules are correct, albeit totally useless in practice. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for function applications *)

(** Consider an application in A-normal form, that is,
    an application of the form [trm_app v1 v2].

    We have [wp]-style rules to reason about the application of
    a known function, e.g. [trm_app (val_fun x t1) v2].
    However, if [v1] is an abstrat value (e.g., a Coq variable
    of type [var]), we have no reasoning rule at hand that applies.

    Thus, we will simply define [wpgen (trm_app v1 v2) Q] as
    [wp (trm_app v1 v2) Q]. In other words, to define [wpgen] for
    a function application, we fall back to the semantic definition of [wp].

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      ...
      | trm_app v1 v2 => wp (trm_app v1 v2) Q
      ...
]]

    As we carry out verification proofs in practice, when reaching
    an application we will face a goal of the form:
[[
    H ==> wpgen (trm_app v1 v2) Q
]]
    By revealing the definition of [wpgen] on applications, we get:
[[
    H ==> wp (trm_app v1 v2) Q
]]
    Then by exploiting the equivalence with triples, we obtain:
[[
    triple (trm_app v1 v2) H Q
]]
    which can be proved by invoking a specification triple for
    the function [v1].

    In other words, by falling back to the semantics definition
    when reaching a function application, we allow the user to choose
    which specification lemma to exploit for reasoning about this
    particular function application. *)

(** Remark: we assume throughout the course that terms are written
    in A-normal form. Nevertheless, we need to define [wpgen] even
    on terms that are not in A-normal form. One possibility is
    to map all these terms to [\[False]]. In the specific case of an
    application of the form [trm_app t1 t2] where [t1] and [t2] are
    not both values, it is still correct to define [wpgen (trm_app t1 t2))
    as [wp (trm_app t1 t2)]. So, we need not bother checking here
    that the arguments of [trm_app] are actually values.

    Thus, the most concise definition for [wpgen] on applications is:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      ...
      | trm_app t1 t2 => wp t Q
      ...
]]

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of [wpgen] for conditionals *)

(** The last remaining case is that for conditionals.
    Recall the [wp]-style reasoning rule stated using
    a Coq conditional. *)

Parameter wp_if : forall (b:bool) t1 t2 Q,
  (if b then (wp t1 Q) else (wp t2 Q)) ==> wp (trm_if b t1 t2) Q.

(** The statement above actually features hidden coercions.
    The right-hand side of the entailment only applies to a term
    of the form [trm_if (trm_val (val_bool b)) t1 t2].

    Yet, we need to define [wpgen] for all conditionals in A-normal
    form, i.e., all terms of the form [trm_if (trm_val v0) t1 t2], where
    [v0] could a value of unknown shape. Typically, a program may feature
    a conditional [trm_if (trm_var x) t1 t2] that, after substitution
    for [x], becomes [trm_if (trm_val v) t1 t2], for some abstract
    [v] of type [val] that might not yet be know to be a boolean value.

    To handle the problem, we pattern match a conditional as [trm_if t0 t1 t2],
    and define its [wpgen] as a heap predicate that requires the existence
    of a boolean [b] such that [t0 = trm_val (val_bool b)].
    This way, we delay the moment at which the argument of the conditional
    needs to be shown to be a boolean value. The formal definition is:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_if t0 t1 t2 =>
          \exists (b:bool), \[t0 = trm_val (val_bool b)]
            \* (if b then (wpgen t1) Q else (wpgen t2) Q)
      ...
]]

*)

(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Summary of the definition of [wpgen] for term rules *)

(** In summary, we have defined:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : hprop :=
      match t with
      | trm_val v => Q v
      | trm_fun x t1 => Q (val_fun x t)
      | trm_fix f x t1 => Q (val_fix f x t)
      | trm_seq t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen t2 Q)
      | trm_let x t1 t2 => wpgen t1 (fun v => wpgen (subst x v t2) Q)
      | trm_var x => \[False]
      | trm_app v1 v2 => wp t Q
      | trm_if t0 t1 t2 =>
          \exists (b:bool), \[t0 = trm_val (val_bool b)]
            \* (if b then (wpgen t1) Q else (wpgen t2) Q)
      end.
]]

    As pointed out earlier, this definition is not structurally recursive
    and thus not accepted by Coq, due to the recursive call
    [wpgen (subst x v t2) Q]. Our next step is to fix this recursion issue. *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Computating with [wpgen] *)

(** [wpgen] is not structurally recursive because of the substitutions
    that takes places in-between recursive calls. To fix this, we are
    going to delay the substitutions until the leaves of the recursion.
    To that end, we introduce a substitution context, written [E], to
    record the substitutions that should have been performed.

    Concretely, we modify the function to take the form [wpgen E t],
    where [E] denotes a set of bindings from variables to values.
    The intention is that [wpgen E t] computes the weakest precondition
    for the term [isubst E t], which denotes the result of substituting
    all bindings from E inside the term [t]. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Definition of contexts and operations on them *)

(** The simplest way to define a context [E] is as an association
    list relating variables to values. *)

Definition ctx : Type := list (var*val).

(** Before we present how the introduction of a context impacts
    the definition of [wpgen], we need to formalize the "iterated
    substitution" operation, written [isubst E t]. The definition
    is relatively standard: the substitution traverses the term
    recursively and, when reaching a variable, performs a lookup
    in the term [E].

    The definition of the [lookup] operation on association lists
    is standard. *)

Fixpoint lookup (x:var) (E:ctx) : option val :=
  match E with
  | nil => None
  | (y,v)::E1 => if var_eq x y
                   then Some v
                   else lookup x E1
  end.

(** One additional technicality is the need to respect variable shadowing,
    which imposes to remove bindings on a variable [x] when entering
    through the scope of a bound variable named [x]. The removal operation
    on a context represented as an association list is also standard. *)

Fixpoint rem (x:var) (E:ctx) : ctx :=
  match E with
  | nil => nil
  | (y,v)::E1 =>
      let E1' := rem x E1 in
      if var_eq x y then E1' else (y,v)::E1'
  end.

(* The definition of the operation [isubst] can then be expressed as a
   recursive function over the term [t]. *)

Fixpoint isubst (E:ctx) (t:trm) : trm :=
  match t with
  | trm_val v =>
       v
  | trm_var x =>
       match lookup x E with
       | None => t
       | Some v => v
       end
  | trm_fun x t1 =>
       trm_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1)
  | trm_fix f x t1 =>
       trm_fix f x (isubst (rem x (rem f E)) t1)
  | trm_app t1 t2 =>
       trm_app (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)
  | trm_seq t1 t2 =>
       trm_seq (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)
  | trm_let x t1 t2 =>
       trm_let x (isubst E t1) (isubst (rem x E) t2)
  | trm_if t0 t1 t2 =>
       trm_if (isubst E t0) (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)
  end.

(** Remark: it would be also possible to define the substitution by
    iterating the unary substitution [subst] over the list of bindings
    from [E], however doing so is much less efficient and would
    complicate proofs. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [wpgen]: the let-binding case *)

(** When [wpgen] traverses a let-binding, rather than eargerly
    performing a substitution, it simply extends the current context.
    Concretely, a call to [wpgen E (trm_let x t1 t2)] triggers a recursive
    call to [wpgen ((x,v)::E) t2]. The corresponding definition is:

(** *** [wpgen]: the variable case *)

(** When [wpgen] reaches a variable, it lookups for a binding
    on the variable [x] inside the context [E]. Concretely, the evaluation
    of [wpgen E (trm_var x)] triggers a call to [lookup x E].

    If the context [E] binds the variable [x] to some value [v], then
    the operation [lookup x E] returns [Some v]. In that case,
    [wpgen] returns the weakest precondition for that value [v],
    that is, [Q v].

    Otherwise, if [E] does not bind [x], the lookup operation returns [None].
    In that case, [wpgen] returns [\[False]], which we have explained to be
    the weakest precondition for a stuck program.

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct (match t with
      ...
      | trm_var x => fun Q =>
           match lookup x E with
           | Some v => Q v
           | None => \[False]
           end
      ...
      ) end.
]]

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [wpgen]: the application case *)

(** In the previous definition of [wpgen] with contexts, the argued
    that the result of [wpgen t Q] in the case where [t] is an application
    should be simply [wp t Q]. In other words, we resort to the semantics
    interpretation for an application.

    In the definition of [wpgen] with contexts, the intepretation of
    [wpgen E t] is the weakest precondition of the term [isubst E t],
    which denotes the result of substituting variables from [E] in [t].

    When [t] is an application, we thus define [wpgen E t] as the formula
    [fun Q => wp (isubst E t) Q], or simply [wp (isubst E t)] by eliminating
    the useless eta-expansion.

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct (match t with
      ...
      | trm_app v1 v2 => wp (isubst E t)
      ..
]]

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [wpgen]: the function definition case *)

(** Consider the case where [t] is a function definition, for example
    [trm_fun x t1]. The formula [wpgen E t] is interpreted as the weakest
    precondition of [isubst E t].

    By unfolding the definition of [isubst] in the case where [t] is
    [trm_fun x t1], we obtain [trm_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1)].

    The weakest precondition for that value is
    [fun Q => Q (val_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1))].
    Thus, [wpgen E t] handles functions, and recursive functions, as follows:

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct (match t with
      ...
      | trm_fun x t1 => fun Q => Q (val_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1))
      | trm_fix f x t1 => fun Q => Q (val_fix f x (isubst (rem x (rem f E)) t1))
      ...
      ) end.
]]

  match t with
  | trm_val v => Q v
  | trm_fun x t1 => Q (val_fun x (isubst (rem x E) t1))

(** Compared with the presentation using the form [wpgen t], the
    new presentation using the form [wpgen E t] has the main benefits
    that it is structurally recursive, thus easy to define in Coq.
    Moreover, it is algorithmically more efficient in general, because
    it performs substitutions easily rather than eagerly. *)

(** Let us state the soundness theorem and its corollary for establishing
    triples for functions. *)

   wpgen E t Q ==> wp (isubst E t) Q.

(** The entailement above asserts in particular that if we can derive

(** There is a corrolary of the soundness theorem that is particularly
    useful for establishing triples for functions. Recall for [SLFRules]: *)

Parameter triple_app_fun : forall x v1 v2 t1 H Q,
  v1 = val_fun x t1 ->

(** If we rewrite the premise [triple (subst x v2 t1) H Q] as a [wp],
    we get [H ==> wp (subst x v2 t1) Q].

    The term [subst x v2 t1] is equal to [isubst ((x,v2)::nil) t1].
    Thus, the heap predicate [wp (subst x v2 t1) Q] is equivalent to
    [wp (isubst ((x,v2)::nil) t1)].

    According to [wpgen_sound], that predicate [wp (isubst ((x,v2)::nil) t1)]
    is entailed by [wpgen ((x,v2)::nil) t1]. Thus, we derive the corollary: *)

Parameter triple_app_fun_from_wpgen : forall v1 v2 x t1 H Q,

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Extension of [wpgen] to handle structural rules *)

(** The definition of [wpgen] proposed so far integrates the logic of
    the reasoning rules for terms, however it lacks support for
    conveniently exploiting the structural rules of the logic.

    We fix this next, by showing how to tweak the definition of [wpgen]
    in such a way that, by construction, it satisfies both
    - the frame rule [(wpgen t Q) \* H ==> wpgen t (Q \*+ H)]
    - and the rule of consequence [wpgen t Q1 ==> wpgen t Q2] when [Q1 ===> Q2].

*)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Introduction of [mkstruct] in the definition of [wpgen] *)

(** Recall from the previous chapter the statement of the
    frame rule in [wp]-style. *)

Parameter wp_frame : forall t H Q,
  (wp t Q) \* H ==> wp t (Q \*+ H).

(** We would like [wpgen] to satisfy the same rule, so that we can
    exploit the frame rule while reasoning about a program using
    the heap predicate produced by [wpgen].

    With the definition of [wpgen] set up so far, it is possible
    to prove, for any concrete term [t], that the frame property
    [(wpgen t Q) \* H ==> wpgen t (Q \*+ H)] holds.
    However, establishing this result requires an induction over
    the entire structure of the term [t]---a lot of tedious work.

    Instead, we are going to tweak the definition of [wpgen] so as to
    produce, at every step of the recursion, a special token to capture
    the idea that whatever the details of the output predicate produced
    by [wpgen], this predicate does satisfy the frame property. *)

(** We achieve this magic by introducing a predicate called [mkstruct],
    and inserting it at the head of the output produced by [wpgen]
    (and all of its recursive invokation) as follows:

[[
    Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : (val->hprop)->hprop :=
      mkstruct (
        match t with
        | trm_val v => wpgen_val v
        ...
        end).
]]

    The interest of the insertion of [mkstruct] above is that every result
    of a computation of [wpgen t] on a concrete term [t] is, by construction,
    of the form [mkstruct F] for some argument [F].

    Third, to enable the function [wpgen] to compute well in Coq,
    we need to swap the [fun Q] with the [match t], so that the
    pattern matching on [t] is visible enough for Coq to simplify it.



    There remains to investigate how [mkstruct] should be defined.

(** In addition, it should be possible to erase [mkstruct] from the head
    of the output produced [wpgen t] when we do not need to apply any
    structural rule. In other words, we need to be able to prove
    [H ==> mkstruct F Q] by proving [H ==> F Q], for any [H].

    Idempotence asserts that applying the predicate [mkstruct] more than
    once does provide more expressiveness than applying it just once.

    Intuitively, idempotence reflects in particular the fact that two nested
    applications of the rule of consequence can always be combined into a
    single application of that rule (due to the transitivity of entailement)
    and that, similarly, two nested applications of the frame rule can always
    be combined into a single application of that rule (framing onÂ [H1] then

(** The soundness theorem that we aim to establish for [wpgen] is:

]]
*)

(** Before we enter the details of the proof, let us reformulate the
    soundness statement of the soundness theorem in a way that will
    make proof obligations and induction hypotheses easier to read.
    To that end, we introduce the predicate [formula_sound t F],
    which asserts that [F] is a weakest-precondition style formula
    that entails [wp t]. Formally: *)

Definition formula_sound (t:trm) (F:formula) : Prop :=
  forall Q, F Q ==> wp t Q.

(** Using [formula_sound], the soundness theorem reformulates as: *)

Parameter wpgen_sound' : forall E t,
  formula_sound (isubst E t) (wpgen E t).


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Soundness for the case of sequences *)

(** Let us forget about the existence of [mkstruct] for a minute,
    that is, pretend that [wpgen] is defined without [mkstruct].

    In that setting, [wpgen E (trm_seq t1 t2)] evaluates to
    [wpgen_seq (wpgen E t1) (wpgen E t2)].

    Recall the definition of [wpgen_seq]:

[[
  Definition wpgen_seq (F1 F2:formula) : formula := fun Q =>
    F1 (fun v => F2 Q).
]]

*)

(** Consider the soundness theorem [wpgen_sound] and in the
    particular case where [t] is of the form [trm_seq t1 t2].
    The corresponding statement is: *)

Parameter wpgen_sound_seq : forall E t1 t2,
  formula_sound (isubst E (trm_seq t1 t2)) (wpgen E (trm_seq t1 t2)).

(** In that statement:

    - [wpgen E (trm_seq t1 t2)] evaluates to
      [wpgen_seq (wpgen E t1) (wpgen E t2)].
    - [isubst E (trm_seq t1 t2)] evaluates to
      [trm_seq (isubst E t1) (isubst E t2)].

    Moreover, by induction hypothesis, we will be able to assume
    the soundness result to already hold for the subterms [t1] and [t2].

    Thus, to establish the soundness of [wpgen] for sequences, we
    have to prove the following result: *)

Parameter wpgen_sound_seq' : forall E t1 t2,

                (wpgen_seq (wpgen E t1) (wpgen E t2)).

(** In the above, let us abstract [isubst E t1] as [t1'] and

    the final statement of the soundness theorem. *)

(** The second property asserts that the substitution for a context
    [(x,v)::E] is the same as the substitution for the context [rem x E]
    followed with the substitution of [x] by [v] using the basic

    For each term construct, the proof case consists of two steps:

    - first, invoke the lemma [mkstruct_sound] to justify soundness
      of the leading [mkstruct] produced by [wpgen],
    - second, invoke the the soundness lemma specific to that term
      construct, e.g. [wpgen_seq_sound] for sequences.

    Yet, this definition of [mkstruct] is circular: it refers to itself.
    Let's overcome the circularity in a radical manner, by getting rid
    of the occurence of [mkstruct] inside its definition.

    Doing so, it turns out, leads to a definition that does satisfy
    the property [mkstruct_conseq] as required. *)

Definition mkstruct1 (F:formula) : formula :=
  fun (Q2:val->hprop) => \exists Q1, F Q1 \* \[Q1 ===> Q2].

Lemma mkstruct1_conseq : forall F Q1 Q2,
  Q1 ===> Q2 ->
  mkstruct1 F Q1 ==> mkstruct1 F Q2.
Proof using. introv M. unfolds mkstruct1. xsimpl. intros Q' N. xchange* N. Qed.

(** The second task is to extend the definition in order to also support
    not just [mkstruct_conseq], but also [mkstruct_frame]. *)

Parameter mkstruct_frame : forall F H Q,
  (mkstruct F Q) \* H ==> mkstruct F (Q \*+ H).

(** Taking inspiration from the rule [wp_conseq_frame] which combines
    the frame rule and the rule of consequence into a single rule, we
    can state a property of [mkstruct] that captures at once the two
    required properties. *)

Parameter mkstruct_conseq_frame : forall F Q1 Q2 H,
  Q1 \*+ H ===> Q2 ->
  H \* (mkstruct F Q1) ==> mkstruct F (Q2 \*+ H).

(** Again, let us reformulate this as an introduction rule for [mkstruct]. *)

Parameter mkstruct_conseq'' : forall F Q2,
  \exists Q1 H, \[Q1 \*+ H ===> Q2] \* H \* (mkstruct F Q1) ==> mkstruct F Q2.

(** Again, eliminating the reference to [mkstruct] on the left-hand side of
    the entailment suggests the following definition. *)

Definition mkstruct (F:formula) : formula :=
  fun (Q2:val->hprop) => \exists Q1 H, F Q1 \* H \* \[Q1 \*+ H ===> Q2].

(** As we have proved earlier in this chapter, this definition indeed satisfies
    all the required properties. In particular, recall [mkstruct_erase]: *)

Parameter mkstruct_erase : forall (F:formula) Q,
  F Q ==> mkstruct F Q.

(** To prove it, instantiate [Q2] from the definition of [mkstruct]Â as [Q],
    and [H]Â as the empty heap predicate. *)

(** Recall that [isubst E t] denotes the multi-substitution
    in the term [t] of all bindings form the association list [E].

    The soundness proof for [wpgen] relies on two properties
    of substitutions, [isubst_nil] and [isubst_rem], which we
    state and prove next:
[[
    isubst nil t = t

    subst x v (isubst (rem x E) t) = isubst ((x,v)::E) t

(** The first lemma is straightforward by induction. *)

Lemma isubst_nil : forall t,

Proof using.

(** The second lemma is much more involved to prove.

    We introduce the notion of "two equivalent contexts"
    [E1] and [E2], and argue that substitution for two
    equivalent contexts yields the same result.

    We then introduce the notion of "contexts with disjoint
    domains", and argue that if [E1] and [E2] are disjoint then
    [isubst (E1 ++ E2) t = isubst E1 (isubst E2 t)]. *)

(** Before we start, we describe the tactic [case_var], which
    helps with the case_analyses on variable equalities,
    and we prove an auxiliary lemma that describes the
    result of a lookup on a context from which a binding
    has been removed. It is defined in file [Var.v] as:
