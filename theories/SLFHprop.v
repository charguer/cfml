(** * The chapter in a rush *)

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Syntax and semantics *)

(** We here assume an imperative programming language with a formal semantics.
    Such a language is described in file [Semantics.v], but we do not need to
    know about the details for now. All we need to know is that there exists:
  
    - a type of terms, written [trm],
    - a type of values, written [val],
    - a type of states, written [state],
    - a big-step evaluation judgment, written [red s1 t s2 v], asserting that,
      starting from state [s1], the evaluation of the term [t] terminates in
      the state [s2] and produces the value [v]. *)

Check red : state -> trm -> state -> val -> Prop.

(** At this point, we don't need to know the exact grammar of terms and values.
    Let's just give one example to make things concrete. Consider the function:
      [fun x => if x then 0 else 1]. 

    In the language described in the file [Semantics.v], it can be
    written in raw syntax as: *)

Definition example_trm : trm :=
  trm_fun "x" (trm_if (trm_var "x") (trm_val (val_int 0)) (trm_val (val_int 1))).

(** Thanks to a set of coercions and notation, this term can be written in a
    more readable way: *)

Definition example_trm' : trm :=
  Fun "x" :=
    If_ "x" Then 0 Else 1.


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Description of the state *)

(** The file [Fmap.v] contains a self-contained formalization of
    finite maps and the associated operations needed for Separation Logic.

    Locations, of type [loc], denote the addresses of allocated objects.
    Locations are a particular kind of values.

    A state is a finite map from locations to values.
      [Definition state := fmap loc val.] *)

(** The main operations and predicates on the state are as follows. *)

Check fmap_empty : state.

Check fmap_single : loc -> val -> state.

Check fmap_union : state -> state -> state.

Check fmap_disjoint : state -> state -> Prop.


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Heap predicates *)

(** In Separation Logic (SL), the state is described using "heap predicates",
    which are predicate over pieces of state.
    We let [hprop] denote the type of heap predicates. *)

Definition hprop := state -> Prop.

(** Thereafter, we use the words "heap" and "state" interchangeably,
    and let [H] range over heap predicates. *)

Implicit Type H : hprop.

(** An essential aspect of Separation Logic is that all heap predicates
    defined and used in practice are built using a few basic combinators.
    In other words, except for the definition of the combinators themselves,
    we will never define a custom heap predicate directly as a function 
    of the state. *)

(** We next describe the most important combinators of Separation Logic. *)

(** The heap predicate, written [\[]], characterizes an empty state. *)

Definition hempty : hprop :=
  fun (s:state) => (s = fmap_empty).

Notation "\[]" := (hempty) (at level 0).

(** The pure fact predicate, written [\[P]], characterizes an empty state
    and moreover asserts that the proposition [P] is true. *)

Definition hpure (P:Prop) : hprop :=
  fun (s:state) => (s = fmap_empty) /\ P.

Notation "\[ P ]" := (hpure P) (at level 0, format "\[ P ]").

(** The singleton heap predicate, written [l ~~> v], characterizes a
    state with a single allocated cell, at location [l], storing the
    value [v]. *)

Definition hsingle (l:loc) (v:val) : hprop :=
  fun (s:state) => (s = fmap_single l v).

Notation "l '~~~>' v" := (hsingle l v) (at level 32).

(** The "separating conjunction", written [H1 \* H2], characterizes a
    state that can be decomposed in two disjoint parts, one that
    satisfies [H1], and another that satisfies [H2].
    In the definition below, the two parts are named [s1] and [s2]. *)

Definition hstar (H1 H2 : hprop) : hprop :=
  fun (s:state) => exists s1 s2, H1 s1
                              /\ H2 s2
                              /\ fmap_disjoint s1 s2
                              /\ s = fmap_union s1 s2.

Notation "H1 '\*' H2" := (hstar H1 H2) (at level 41, right associativity).

(** The existential quantifier for heap predicates, written [\exists x, H]
    characterizes a heap that satisfies [H] for some [x].
    The variable [x] has type [A], for some arbitrary type [A].

    The notation [\exists x, H] stands for [hexists (fun x => H)].
    The generalized notation [\exists x1 ... xn, H] is also available.

    The definition of [hexists] is a bit technical. It may be skipped 
    in first reading. additional explanations are given further on. *)

Definition hexists A (J:A->hprop) : hprop :=
  fun (s:state) => exists x, J x s.

Notation "'\exists' x1 .. xn , H" :=
  (hexists (fun x1 => .. (hexists (fun xn => H)) ..))
  (at level 39, x1 binder, H at level 50, right associativity,
   format "'[' '\exists' '/ ' x1  ..  xn , '/ ' H ']'").

(** The "top" heap predicate, written [\Top], holds of any heap predicate.
    It plays a useful role for denoting pieces of state that needs to be discarded,
    to reflect in the logic the action of the garbage collector. *)

Definition htop : hprop :=
  fun (s:state) => True.

Notation "\Top" := (htop).


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Type and syntax for postconditions *)

(** A postcondition characterizes both an output value and an output state.
    In SL, a postcondition is thus a relation of type [val -> state -> Prop],
    which is equivalent to [val -> hprop]. 

    Thereafter, we let [Q] range over postconditions. *)

Implicit Type Q : val -> hprop.

(** One common operation is to augment a postcondition with a piece of state.
    This operation is described by the operator [Q \*+ H], which is just a
    convenient notation for [fun x => (Q x \* H)]. *)

Notation "Q \*+ H" := (fun x => hstar (Q x) H) (at level 40).


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Separation Logic triples and the frame rule *)

(** A Separation Logic triple is a generalization of a Hoare triple
    that integrate builtin support for the "frame rule". Before we give
    the definition of a Separation Logic triple, let us first give
    the definition of a Hoare triple and state the much-desired frame rule. *)

(** A Hoare triple, written [{H}t{Q}] on paper, and here written
    [Hoare_triple H t Q], asserts that starting from a state [s] satisfying
    the precondition [H], the term [t] evaluates to a value [v] and to
    a state [s'] that, together, satisfy the postcondition [Q]. Formally: *)

Definition Hoare_triple (H:hprop) (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : Prop :=
  forall s, H s ->
  exists v s', red s t s' v /\ Q v s'.

(** The frame rule asserts that if one can derive a specification of
    the form [triple H t Q] for a term [t], then one should be able
    to automatically derive [triple (H \* H') t (Q \*+ H')] for any [H'].
    Intuitively, if [t] executes safely in a heap [H], it should behave
    similarly in any extension of [H] with a disjoint part [H'], moreover
    its evaluation should leave this piece of state [H'] unmodified until
    the end. 

    The following definition of a Separation Logic triple builds upon
    that of a Hoare triple by "baking in" the frame rule. *)

Definition triple (H:hprop) (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : Prop :=
  forall (H':hprop), Hoare_triple (H \* H') t (Q \*+ H').

(** This definition inherently satisfies the frame rule.
    To carry out the proof, the only fact that we need to exploit
    is the associativity of the star operator, which we will 
    establish in the next chapter. *)

Parameter hstar_assoc : forall H1 H2 H3,
  (H1 \* H2) \* H3 = H1 \* (H2 \* H3).

Lemma frame_rule : forall H t Q H', 
  triple H t Q ->
  triple (H \* H') t (Q \*+ H').
Proof using.
  introv M. unfold triple in *. rename H' into H1. intros H2.
  specializes M (H1 \* H2).
  (* [M] matches the goal up to rewriting for associativity. *)
  applys_eq M 1 3.
  { rewrite hstar_assoc. auto. }
  { applys fun_ext_1. intros v. rewrite hstar_assoc. auto. }
Qed.

(** The actual definition of a Separation Logic triple accounts
    for the fact that pieces of heap may need to get discarded.
    To that end, we augment the postcondition with a [\Top], 
    which can capture any piece of state that we do not wish to
    mention explicitly in the postcondition. *)

Definition triple' (H:hprop) (t:trm) (Q:val->hprop) : Prop :=
  forall (H':hprop), Hoare_triple (H \* H') t (Q \*+ H' \*+ \Top).

(** Depending on the exact set up of the Separation Logic,
    this [\Top] predicate may be replaced by a finer-grained
    definition (so as to obtain a linear or partially-linear,
    logic, instead of a fully affine logic). This distinction 
    is the matter of a more advanced chapter. *)


(* ####################################################### *)
(** * Additional explanations for the definition of [\exists] *)

(** The heap predicate [\exists (n:int), l ~~~> (val_int n)] characterizes
    a state that contains a single memory cell, at address [l], storing
    the integer value [n], for "some" (unspecified) integer [n]. *)

Module HexistsExample.
  Parameter (l:loc).
  Check (\exists (n:int), l ~~~> (val_int n)) : hprop.
End HexistsExample.

(** The type of [\exists], which operates on [hprop], is very similar 
    to that of [exists], which operates on [Prop]. 

    The notation [exists x, P] stands for [ex (fun x => P)],
    where [ex] admits the following type: *)

Check ex : forall A : Type, (A -> Prop) -> Prop.

(** Likewise, [\exists x, H] stands for [hexists (fun x => H)],
    where [hexists] admits the following type: *)

Check hexists : forall A : Type, (A -> hprop) -> hprop.

(** Remark: the notation for [\exists] is directly adapted from that 
    of [exists], which supports the quantification an arbitrary number
    of variables, and is defined in [Coq.Init.Logic] as follows. *)

Notation "'exists' x .. y , p" := (ex (fun x => .. (ex (fun y => p)) ..))
  (at level 200, x binder, right associativity,
   format "'[' 'exists' '/ ' x .. y , '/ ' p ']'").



(* ####################################################### *)
(** * Alterative definitions for heap predicates *)

(** In what follows, we discuss alternative, equivalent defininitions for
    the fundamental heap predicates. We write these equivalence using 
    equalities of the form [H1 = H2]. We will justify later the use of 
    the equal sign for relating predicates. *)

(** The empty heap predicate [\[]] is equivalent to the pure fact predicate
    [\[True]]. Thus, [hempty] could be defined in terms of [hpure]. *)

Parameter hempty_eq_hpure_true :
  \[] = \[True].

Definition hempty' : hprop :=
  \[True].

(** The pure fact predicate [[\P]] is equivalent to the existential
    quantification over a proof of [P] in the empty heap, that is,
    to the heap predicate [\exists (p:P), \[]]. Thus, [hpure] could
    be defined in terms of [hexists] and [hempty]. *)

Parameter hpure_eq_hexists_proof : forall P,
  \[P] = \[True].

Definition hpure' (P:Prop) : hprop :=
  \exists (p:P), \[].

(** We like to reduce the number of combinators to the minimum number,
    both for elegance and to reduce the subsesquent proof effort.
    Since we cannot do without [hexists], we have a choice between
    considering either [hpure] or [hempty] as primitive, and the other
    one as derived. The predicate [hempty] is simpler and appears as
    more fundamental. Hence, in practice we define [hpure] in terms of
    [hexists] and [hempty], as done in the definition [hpure'] above. *)

(** The top heap predicate [\Top] is equivalent to [\exists H, H], 
    which is a heap predicate that also characterizes any state.
    Again, because we need [hexists] anyway, we prefer in practice
    to define [\Top] in terms of [hexists], as done in the definition
    of [htop'] shown below. *)

Parameter htop_eq_hexists_hprop :
  \Top = (\exists (H:hprop), H).

Definition htop' : hprop :=
  \exists (H:hprop), H.
