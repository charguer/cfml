(** * Chapter in a rush *)

(** This chapter introduces support for reasoning about mutable records
    and mutable arrays,

    To allocate records and arrays, we introduce two new primitive operations,
    named [val_alloc] and [val_dealloc], for allocating and deallocating
    at once a range of consecutive memory cells.

    For example, applying [val_alloc] to the integer value [3] would return
    a pointer [p] together with the ownership of three cells: one at
    location [p], one at location [p+1], and one atlocation [p+2].

    This allocation model, which exposes pointer arithmetics, provides a way
    to model both records and arrays with minimal extension to the semantics
    of the programming language that we have considered sor far in the course.

    The cells allocated using [val_alloc] are assigned as contents a special
    value, named [val_uninit], to reflect for the fact that their contents has
    never been set. Remark: in OCaml, one must provide an initialization
    value explicitly, so there is no such thing as [val_uninit]; in JavaScript,
    [val_uninit] is called [undefined]; in Java, arrays are initialized with
    zeros; in C, uninitialized data should not be read---we could implement
    this policy in our language by restricting the evaluation rule for the read
    operation, adding a premise of the form [v <> val_uninit] to the rule.

*)

(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Updated source language *)

(** The language is assumed to not include [val_ref] and [val_free],
    but instead include primitive [val_alloc] and [val_dealloc] for
    allocating blocks of cells.

    The grammar of values is extended with two constructors:

    - [val_uninit] describes the contents of an uninitialized cell.
    - [val_header k] describes the contents of a header block for an
      array or a record.

*)

Parameter val_uninit : val.
Parameter val_header : nat -> val.

Parameter val_uninit_neq_header :
  forall k, val_uninit <> val_header k.
(* Would be free if constructors were part of the inductive definition of [val] *)

(** New primitive operations:

    - [val_get_header p] to read a header, e.g., to get the length of an array,
    - [val_alloc k] to allocate a block of [k] consecutive cells,
    - [val_dealloc p] to deallocate the block at location [p].

*)

Parameter val_get_header : prim.
Parameter val_alloc : prim.
Parameter val_dealloc : prim.

(** Semantics of allocation, deallocation, and reading of headers *)

Parameter eval_alloc : forall k n ma mb p,
  mb = Fmap.conseq (val_header k :: LibList.make k val_uninit) p ->
  n = nat_to_Z k ->
  p <> null ->
  Fmap.disjoint ma mb ->
  eval ma (val_alloc (val_int n)) (mb \+ ma) (val_loc p).

Parameter eval_dealloc : forall k vs ma mb p,
  mb = Fmap.conseq (val_header k :: vs) p ->
  k = LibList.length vs ->
  Fmap.disjoint ma mb ->
  eval (mb \+ ma) (val_dealloc (val_loc p)) ma val_unit.

Parameter eval_get_header : forall s p k,

(** ** Representation of a set of consecutive cells *)

Module Cells.

(** An array of length [k] allocated at location [p] can be represented
    as a range of [k] consecutive cells starting from location [p]. In other
    words, the array cells have addresses from [p] inclusive to [p+k]
    exclusive.

    The contents of an array of length [k] can be represented by a list
    of values of length [k]. This idea is formalized by the predicate [hcells].

    The heap predicate [hcells L p] represents a consecutive set of cells
    starting at location [p] and whose elements are described by the list [L].

    On paper, we could write something along the lines of:
    [\bigstar_{x at index i in L} { (p+i) ~~> x }].

    In Coq, we can define this predicate by induction on the list [L], with
    the pointer being incremented by one unit at each cell, as follows.
*)

Fixpoint hcells (L:list val) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  match L with
  | nil => \[]
  | x::L' => (p ~~> x) \* (hcells L' (S p))
  end.


(** The description of an array, that is, a set of consecutive cells,
    can be split in two parts, at an arbitrary index. Concretely, if
    we have [harray (L1++L2) p], then we can separate the left part
    [harray L1 p] from the right   part [harray L2 q], where the address
    [q] is equal to [p + length L1]. Reciprocally, the two parts can
    be merged back into the original form at any time. *)

Parameter hcells_concat_eq : forall p L1 L2,
  hcells (L1++L2) p = (hcells L1 p \* hcells L2 (length L1 + p)%nat).

(** This "splitting lemma for arrays" is useful to carry out local
    reasoning on arrays, by focusing on the segment of the array involved
    in each recursive call, and obtaining for free the fact that the
    cells outside of the segment remain unmodified.

    The proof of the splitting lemma appears appears in the bonus section
    of this chapter. *)

(*
Definition vals : Type := list val.
*)

Parameter hcells_focus : forall k p L,
  k < length L ->
  hcells L p ==>
       ((p+k)%nat ~~> LibList.nth k L)
    \* (\forall w, ((p+k)%nat ~~> w) \-* hcells (LibList.update k w L) p).


(** Given a heap predicate [hcells L p], one can deduce that [p] is not
    null, but only if the list [L] is not empty. In order to avoid in
    proofs the need to treat specially the case empty arrays, it is
    convenient to pack together with [hcells L p] the fact [p] is not null,
    reflecting the fact that no data can be allocated at the null location,
    not even an empty array.

    The heap predicate [harray L p] packs together [hcells L p] with the
    information [p <> null].
*)

Parameter hheader : forall (k:nat) (p:loc), hprop.

Definition harray (L:list val) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  hheader (length L) p \* hcells L (S p).

Parameter harray_not_null : forall p L,
  harray L p ==> harray L p \* \[p <> null].

(** ** Specification of the allocation of consecutive cells *)

(** The operation [val_alloc k] allocates [k] consecutive cells. Let [p]
    denote the pointer returned. The allocated cells have addresses in
    the range from [p] inclusive to [p+k] exclusive. These cells have for
    contents is the special value [val_uninit], which we assume to be part
    of the grammar of values. *)

(** The heap produced by [val_alloc k] can be described by [harray L p],
    for a list [L] that consists of [k] occurences of the value [val_uninit].
    Such a list is formally described by [LibList.make k val_uninit].

    We introduce the heap predicate [harray_uninit k p] to denote the
    specialization of [harray] to that list [LibList.make k val_uninit]. *)

Definition harray_uninit (k:nat) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  harray (LibList.make k val_uninit) p.

(** Let us specify the behavior of the allocation function using a
    triple. We first state a specification with an argument of type [nat],
    then reformulate the specification with an argument of type [int].

    Consider a natural number [k]. Thanks to coercions, it may also be
    viewed as an integer value of type [val].

    The operation [val_alloc k] admits an empty precondition. Its
    postcondition asserts that the return value [r] is of the form
    [val_loc p] for some location [p], and that the final state
    satisfies the heap predicate [harray_uninit k p]. Recall that this
    predicate describes [k] cells at consecutive addresses starting from
    location [p], with uninitialized contents. *)

Parameter triple_alloc_nat : forall k,
  triple (val_alloc k)
    \[]
    (funloc p => harray_uninit k p).

(** We next generalize this specification so that it can handle applications
    of the form [val_alloc n], where [n] is a nonnegative integer. Such a
    presentation avoids the need to exhibit the natural number that corresponds
    to the value [n].

    The new specification, shown below, features the premise [n >= 0]. Its
    postcondition involves the predicate [hcells (abs n) p], where [abs]
    converts a nonnegative [int] value into the corresponding [nat] value. *)

Lemma triple_alloc : forall n,
  n >= 0 ->
  triple (val_alloc n)
    \[]
    (funloc p => harray_uninit (abs n) p).
Proof using.
  introv N. rewrite <- (@abs_nonneg n) at 1; [|auto].
  xtriple. xapp triple_alloc_nat. xsimpl*.
Qed.

(** The specification above turns out to be often unncessarily precise.
    For most applications, it is sufficient for the postcondition to
    describe the array as [harray L p] for some unspecified list [L]
    of length [n]. This weaker specification is stated and proved next. *)

Lemma triple_alloc_array : forall n,
  n >= 0 ->
  triple (val_alloc n)
    \[]
    (funloc p => \exists L, \[n = length L] \* harray L p).

    { rewrite length_make. rewrite* abs_nonneg. } }
Qed.


(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Specification of the deallocation of consecutive cells *)

(** The deallocation operation [val_dealloc n p] deallocates [n]
    consecutive cells starting from the location [p]. It admits the
    precondition [harray L p], where [L] can be any list of length [n],
    and its postcondition is empty. *)

Parameter triple_dealloc : forall L p,
  triple (val_dealloc p)
    (harray L p)
    (fun _ => \[]).

(** Remark: in the C programming language, the argument [n] needs not be
    provided, because the system keeps track of the size of allocated blocks.
    One aspect that our simple semantics does not take into account is that
    in C one can invoke the deallocation function only on pointers that were
    produced by the allocation function. Extensions to the heap model and to
    the Separation Logic can be devised to enforce this policy, yet they are
    beyond the scope of this course. *)

(** In the specification of deallocation presented above, the precondition
    [harray L p] is stronger than it needs to be. Indeed, it would suffices
    to require [hcells L p] in the precondition. Depending on the use case,
    it may be easier for the user to not carry around the fact [p <> null],
    which is embedded with [harray L p]. *)


(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Specification of array operations *)

Module Arrays.

(** The operation [val_array_get p i] returns the contents of the [i]-th
    cell of the array at location [p]. *)

Parameter val_array_get : val.

(** The specification of [val_array_get] is as follows. The precondition
    describes the array in the form [harray L p], with a premise that
    requires the index [i] to be in the valid range, that is, between
    zero (inclusive) and the length of [L] (exclusive). The postcondition
    asserts that the result value is [nth (abs i) L], and mentions
    the unmodified array, still described by [harray L p]. *)

Parameter triple_array_get : forall L p i,
  0 <= i < length L ->
  triple (val_array_get p i)
    (harray L p)
    (fun r => \[r = LibList.nth (abs i) L] \* harray L p).

(** The operation [val_array_set p i v] updates the contents of the [i]-th
    cell of the array at location [p]. *)

Parameter val_array_set : val.

(** The specification of [val_array_set] admits the same precondition as
    [val_array_get], with [harray L p] and the constraint [0 <= i < length L].
    Its postcondition describes the updated array using a predicate of the
    form [harray L' p], where [L'] corresponds to [update (abs i) v L]. *)

Parameter triple_array_set : forall L p i v,
  0 <= i < length L ->
  triple (val_array_set p i v)
    (harray L p)
    (fun _ => harray (LibList.update (abs i) v L) p).

Hint Resolve triple_array_get triple_array_set : triple.

(** Array length *)

Parameter val_array_length : val.

Parameter triple_array_length : forall L p,
  triple (val_array_length p)
    (harray L p)
    (fun r => \[r = length L] \* harray L p).

Parameter triple_array_length_header : forall k p,
  triple (val_array_length p)
    (hheader k p)
    (fun r => \[r = (k:int)] \* hheader k p).

End Arrays.


(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Representation of a record field *)

(** A record can be represented as a set of fields stored in consecutive
    addresses. The field names thus correspond to offsets, represented as
    natural numbers. We let [field] denote the type of field names. *)

Definition field : Type := nat.

(** For example, consider a mutable list cell allocated at location [p].
    It consists of a record with a [head] field storing a value [x], and
    a tail field storing a value [q]. This list cell an be represented by
    the heap predicate [(p ~~> x) \* ((p+1) ~~> q)].

    If we define [head := 0] and [tail := 1], the same heap predicate can
    be written [((p+head) ~~> x) \* ((p+tail) ~~> q)].

    To better suggest that we are talking about record fields, and also to
    abstract away from the details of pointer arithmetics, we introduce the
    notation [p`.k ~~> v] to denote [(p+k) ~~> v]. Here, [k] denotes by
    convention a field name, where field names correspond to a natural
    numbers. In first approximation, the definition is as shown below. *)

Definition hfield' (p:loc) (k:field) (v:val) : hprop :=
  (p+k)%nat ~~> v.

(** It is convenient in verification proofs to be able to assume that
    whenever we write [p`.k ~~> v], we refer to a location [p] that is
    not null. (For an example, see the use of the lemma [hfield_not_null]
    inside the proof of the lemma [MList_if] in file [SLFBasic.v].)

    To enable justifying this lemma [hfield_not_null], whose statement
    appears further below, we bake in the definition of [p`.k ~~> v] the
    fact that [p] is not null, using the pure assertion [\[p <> null]]. *)

Definition hfield (p:loc) (k:field) (v:val) : hprop :=
  (p+k)%nat ~~> v \* \[p <> null].

Notation "p `. k '~~>' v" := (hfield p k v)
  (at level 32, k at level 0, no associativity,
   format "p `. k  '~~>'  v").

(** The lemma [hfield_not_null] asserts that the heap predicate [p`.k ~~> v]
    always ensures [p <> null]. *)

Lemma hfield_not_null : forall p k v,
  (p`.k ~~> v) ==> (p`.k ~~> v) \* \[p <> null].
Proof using. intros. unfold hfield. xsimpl*. Qed.

(** To prevent undesirable simplifications, we set the definition [hfield]
    to be opaque. Still, it is useful in places to be able to unfold the
    definition. To that end, we state a lemma for unfolding the definition.
    In its statement, we replace the addition [p+k] with the addition [k+p],
    because the later simplifies better in Coq when [k] is a constant. *)

Lemma hfield_eq : forall p k v,
  hfield p k v = ((k+p)%nat ~~> v \* \[p <> null]).

(** ** Allocation and deallocation of record fields *)

(** We can allocate a fresh mutable list cell by invoking the primitive
    operation [val_alloc] with argument [2]. Let us prove that the result,
    described by [hcell 2 p], can be also be viewed as the heap predicate
    [(p`.head ~~> val_uninit) \* (p`.tail ~~> val_uninit)],
    which describes the two fields of the record, with uninitialized
    contents. *)

(** Reciprocally, we can deallocate a mutable list cell at location [p]
    by invoking the primitive operation [val_dealloc] with argument [2].
    The precondition describes the two fields [p`.head ~~> x] and
    [p`.tail ~~> q]. The postcondition is empty: the fields are lost. *)

Fixpoint hcells_any (k:nat) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  match k with
  | O => \[]

(** Remark: in the proof above, we exploit the rule [triple_dealloc_hcells_any].
    If we used instead the rule [triple_dealloc_hcells], we would have
    to provide explicitly the list of the contents of the cells, by invoking
    [xapp (@triple_dealloc_hcells (x::(val_loc q)::nil))]. Instead,
    thanks to [hcells_any], the existentially-quantified associated with each
    of the cells get automatically inferred by [xsimpl]. *)


(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Reading and writing in record fields *)

(** For reading and writing in record fields, we introduce the operations
    [val_get_field] and [val_set_field]. As we show in the bonus section
    of this chapter, these functions can be defined in terms of the operations
    [val_get] and [val_set], if we assume available a pointer addition operation.

    For the moment, let us simply axiomatize these operations, and state
    their specifications.

    The expression [val_get_field] has type [field -> val]. Given a field
    name [k] (of type [field], which is defined as [nat]), the expression
    [val_get_field k] denotes a value of type [val] that can be applied to
    an argument [p].

    The specification of [val_get_field k p] follows the pattern of the
    specification of [val_get]. The precondition and the postcondition
    describe a field [p`.k ~~> v], and the result value [r] is specified
    to be equal to [v]. *)

Parameter triple_set_field : forall v p k v',

(** We introduce the syntax [t'.k] for reading from a field using
    [val_get_field], and [Set t1'.k := t2] for writing into a field
    using [val_set_field]. *)

Notation "t1 ''.' k" :=

  (at level 65, t1 at level 0, k at level 0, format "'Set' t1 ''.' k  '':=' t2").

(** ** Grouped representation of record fields *)

Module GroupedFields.
Export FieldAccesses.

(** In our presentation of record fields, one has to write the
    fields one by one, for example a list cell takes the form:
    [p`.head ~~> x \* p`.tail ~~> q].

    When verifying larger programs, it is convenient to exploit
    a more compact description of records, one that factorizes
    the fields associated with a same location [p]. The syntax
    for a list cell is [hrecord `{ head := x; tail := p'} p].

    This factorized form has at least two practical benefits:

    - it yields a more concise statement whenever the location [p]
      is not a very short identifier;
    - it significantly decreases the number of star-separated
      items in the heap predicates, thereby increasing the speed
      of proof processing.

    It what follows, we introduce a generic representation predicate
    for records, written [hecord kvs p], where [kvs] denotes a list
    of pairs, each pair being made of a field name and a value. *)

(** Recall that a field identifier corresponds to an offset,
    represented as a natural number. *)

Definition field : Type := nat.

(** A record field is described as the pair of a a field and
    a value stored at this field. *)

Definition hrecord_field : Type := (field * val).

(** A record consists of a list of record fields. We let the
    meta-variable [kvs] denote such lists. *)

Definition hrecord_fields : Type := list hrecord_field.

Implicit Types kvs : hrecord_fields.

(** To improve readability for concrete records, it is useful to
    introduce record-style notation for list of pairs of fields
    and values. Setting up an arity-generic notation is quite tricky,
    so let us simply support up to 3 fields for now. For example,
    [`{head := x; tail := q}] stands for [(head,x)::(tail,q)::nil]].

(** The heap predicate [hrecord_part kvs p] asserts that at location [p]

    This predicate is defined by recursion on the list of fields [kvs].
    If [kvs] is empty, the predicate describes the empty heap predicate.
    Otherwise, it describes a first field, at offset [k] and with contents
    [v], as the predicate [p`.k ~~> v], and it describes the remaining
    fields recursively. *)

(** For example, the definition of the representation predicate
    [MList] can be revisited using the heap predicate [hrecord],
    applied to a list with the [head] and the [tail] fields. *)

Module AllocSpec.

    of the allocation function through the lemma [triple_alloc_nat]. *)

Parameter triple_alloc_nat' : forall k,
  triple (val_alloc k)
    \[]
    (funloc p => harray_uninit k p).

(** Like for other operations, this specification can be proved correct
    with respect to the semantics of the programming language.

    The allocation operation [val_alloc n] can be described as extending
    the state with a range of fresh consecutive cells. The corresponding
    evaluation rule appears below.

    In this rule, we write [LibList.make k val_uninit] for a list that
    repeats [k] times the value [val_uninit]. We write [Fmap.conseq L p]
    for a heap made of consecutive cells, starting at location [p], and
    whose contents are described by the elements from the list [L]. This
    heap is named [mb], and it extends the existing heap, which is named [ma]. *)

Parameter eval_alloc : forall k n ma mb p,
  mb = Fmap.conseq (LibList.make k val_uninit) p ->
  n = nat_to_Z k ->
  p <> null ->
  Fmap.disjoint ma mb ->
  eval ma (val_alloc (val_int n)) (Fmap.union mb ma) (val_loc p).

(** To verify the specification of allocation, the crux of the proof
    is to establish the lemma [harray_uninit_intro], which establishes
    that the heap built by [Fmap.conseq] in the rule [eval_alloc]
    satisfies the predicate [harray_uninit] that appears in the
    postcondition of [triple_alloc_nat].

    This lemma itself relies on an introduction lemma for [hcells],
    asserting that [Fmap.conseq p L] satisfies [hcells L p].

    The two lemmas involved are stated and proved below. It is not
    needed to follow through the proof details. *)

(** Similarly, we can formalize the behavior and the specification of
    the deallocation operation [val_dealloc n p].

    This time, the initial state is of the union of a heap [mb], describing
    the part to be deallocated, and a disjoint heap [ma], describing the
    part of the state that remains. The heap [mb] must correspond to [n]
    consecutive cells, starting at location [p]. This heap is described by
    [Fmap.conseq vs p], for a list of values [vs]. *)

  n = LibList.length vs ->
  Fmap.disjoint ma mb ->
  eval (Fmap.union mb ma) (val_dealloc (val_int n) (val_loc p)) ma val_unit.

(** To verify the specification of deallocation, the crux of the proof
    is to establish that if a heap satisfies [hcells L p], then this
    heap is described by [Fmap.conseq L p].

    This inversion lemma, reciprocal to [hcells_intro], is stated as
    follows. The proof is by induction on the list [L]. (It is not

(** Pointer arithmetic can be useful in particular to define access
    operations an arrays and on records in terms of the primitive
    operations [val_get] and [val_set]. Let us describe the semantics
    and specification of the operation that adds on offset to a pointer.

    The operation [val_ptr p n] applies to a pointer [p] and an integer [n].
    The integer [n] may be negative, as long as [p+n] corresponds to a
    valid location, i.e., [p+n] must be nonnegative. The evaluation rule
    for pointer addition is stated as follows. *)

(** ** Definition of array operations using pointer arithmetic *)

Module ArrayOps.
Import SLFProgramSyntax.

(** As we show, array operations can be encoded using pointer arithmetic.
    For example, an array operation on the [i]-th cell of an array at
    location [p] can be implemented within our language, as the application
    of a read or write operation at the address [p+i].

    In order to reason about the read or write operation on a specific
    cell, we need to isolate this cell from the other cells of the array.
    Then, after the operation, we need to fold back to the view on the
    entire array.

    The isolation process is captured in a general way by the following
    "focus lemma". It reads as follows. Assume [harray L p] to initially
    describe the full array. Then, the [k]-th cell can be isolated as a
    predicate [(p+k) ~~> v], where [v] denotes the [k]-th item of [L],
    that is [LibList.nth k L].

    What remains of the heap can be described using the magic wand operator
    as [((p+k) ~~> v) \-* (harray L p)], which captures the idea that when
    providing back the cell at location [p+k], one would regain the
    ownership of the full array. *)

Parameter harray_focus_read : forall k p v L,
  k < length L ->
  v = LibList.nth k L ->
  harray L p ==>
       ((p+k)%nat ~~> v)
    \* ((p+k)%nat ~~> v \-* harray L p).

(** The above lemma works for read operations but falls short for a
    write operation, because it imposes the array to be put back in
    its original form. It does not take into account the possibility
    to fold back the array with a modified contents for the cell at [p+k].

    This observation leads us to generalize the magic wand that describes
    the rest of the array into the form:
    [\forall w, ((p+k)%nat ~~> w) \-* harray (LibList.update k w L) p].
    This predicate indicates that, for any new contents [w], the array can
    be folded back into [harray L' p], where [L'] denotes the update of
    the list [L] with [w] at location [k] (instead of [v]).

    Note that this form is strictly more general than the previous one,
    because [w] may be instantiated as [v] in case the array is unmodified.

    We state and prove the more general focus lemma as follows. *)

Lemma harray_focus : forall k p L,
  k < length L ->
  harray L p ==>
       ((p+k)%nat ~~> LibList.nth k L)
    \* (\forall w, ((p+k)%nat ~~> w) \-* harray (LibList.update k w L) p).
Proof using.
  introv E. gen k p. induction L as [|x L']; rew_list; intros.
  { false. math. }
  { simpl. rewrite nth_cons_case. case_if.
    { subst. math_rewrite (p + 0 = p)%nat.
       rewrite harray_cons_eq. xsimpl. intros w.
       rewrite LibList.update_zero. rewrite harray_cons_eq. xsimpl*. }
    { rewrite harray_cons_eq.
      forwards R: IHL' (k-1)%nat (S p). { math. }
      math_rewrite (S p + (k - 1) = p + k)%nat in R. xchange R.
      xsimpl. intros w. xchange (hforall_specialize w).
      rewrite update_cons_pos; [|math]. rewrite harray_cons_eq. xsimpl. } }
Qed.

(** Using the focus lemma, we are able to verify the operations on
    arrays encoded using pointer arithmetic.

    In the proofs below, the following mathematical lemma is useful to
    verify that indices remain in the bounds. It is proved in [SLFExtra]. *)

Parameter abs_lt_inbound : forall i k,
  0 <= i < nat_to_Z k ->
  (abs i < k).

(** Consider the read operation in an array, written [val_array_get p i].
    We can define it as [val_get (val_ptr_add p i)], then prove its
    specification expressed in terms of [LibList.nth (abs i) L]. *)

  Fun 'p 'i :=
    Let 'n := val_ptr_add 'p 'i in
    val_get 'n.

Lemma triple_array_get : forall p i L,
  0 <= i < length L ->
  triple (val_array_get p i)
    (harray L p)
    (fun r => \[r = LibList.nth (abs i) L] \* harray L p).
Proof using.

  rewrite update_nth_same. xsimpl*. { applys* abs_lt_inbound. }

(** Consider now a write operation, written [val_array_set p i v].
    We can define it as [val_set (val_ptr_add p i) v], then prove its
    specification expressed in terms of [LibList.update (abs i) v L]. *)
