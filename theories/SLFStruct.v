(** * Chapter in a rush *)

(** This chapter introduces support for reasoning about

    - mutable records,
    - mutable arrays,
    - n-ary functions (i.e., functions of several arguments).

    To allocate records and arrays, we introduce a new primitive operation,
    named [val_alloc], that allocates at once a set of memory cells with
    consecutive addresses.

    For example, applying [val_alloc] to the integer value [3] would return
    a pointer [p] together with the ownership of three cells: one at
    location [p], one at location [p+1], and one atlocation [p+2].
    This allocation model that exposes pointer arithmetics provides a way
    to model both records and arrays with minimal extension to the semantics
    of the programming language that we consider for the course.

    The cells allocated using [val_alloc] are assigned as contents a special
    value, named [val_uninit], to reflect for the fact that their contents has
    never been set. Remark: in OCaml, one must provide an initialization
    value explicitly, so there is no such thing as [val_uninit]; in JavaScript,
    [val_uninit] is called [undefined]; in Java, arrays are initialized with
    zeros; in C, uninitialized data should not be read---we could implement
    this policy in our languageby restricting the evaluation rule for the read
    operation, adding a premise of the form [v <> val_uninit] to the rule.

    Regarding n-ary functions, that is, there are three possible approaches:

    - native n-ary functions, e.g., [function(x, y) { t } ] in C syntax.
    - curried functions, e.g., [fun x => fun y => t] in OCaml syntax.
    - tupled functions, e.g., [fun (x,y) => t] in OCaml syntax.

    In this chapter, we present reasoning rules for curried functions,
    again because this choice requires minimal extension to the syntax and
    semantics of our language. We discuss in the bonus section the treatment
    of native n-ary functions, which is the most practical solution from an
    engineering point of view.

(** ** Representation of a set of consecutive cells *)

Module Cells.

(** An array of length [k] allocated at location [p] can be represented
    as a set of [k] consecutive cells starting from location [p]. In other
    words, the array cells have addresses from [p] inclusive to [p+k]
    inclusive. Just like records, arrays can be allocated using the
    [val_alloc] primitive operation, and read and write operations on
    array cells can be derived. *)

(** The contents of an array of length [k] can be represented by a list
    of values of length [k].

    The heap predicate [hcells L p] represents a consecutive set of cells
    starting at location [p] and whose elements are described by the list [L].

    On paper, we could write something along the lines of:
    [\bigstar_{x at index i in L} { (p+i) ~~> x }].

    In Coq, we can define this predicate by induction on the list [L], with
    the pointer being incremented by one unit at each cell, as follows.
*)

Fixpoint hcells (L:list val) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  match L with
  | nil => \[]
  | x::L' => (p ~~> x) \* (hcells L' (S p))
  end.

(** Given a heap predicate [hcells L p], one can deduce that [p] is not
    null, but only if the list [L] is not empty. In order to avoid in
    proofs the need to treat specially the case empty arrays, it is
    convenient to pack together with [hcells L p] the information [p <> null],
    reflecting the fact that no data can be allocated at the null location,
    not even an empty array.

    The heap predicate [harray L p] packs together [hcells L p] with the
    information that [p] is not null.
*)

Definition harray (L:list val) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  hcells L p \* \[p <> null].

Lemma harray_not_null : forall p L,
  L <> nil ->
  harray L p ==> harray L p \* \[p <> null].
Proof using. introv N. unfold harray. xsimpl*. Qed.

(** The description of an array, that is, a set of consecutive cells,
    can be split in two parts, at an arbitrary index. Concretely, if
    we have [harray (L1++L2) p], then we can separate the left part
    [harray L1 p] from the right part [harray L2 q], where the address
    [q] is equal to [p + length L1]. Reciprocally, the two parts can
    be merged back into the original form at any time. *)

Parameter harray_concat_eq : forall p L1 L2,
  harray (L1++L2) p = (harray L1 p \* harray L2 (length L1 + p)%nat).

(** The proof of this lemma appears may be found in the bonus section of
    this chapter. *)

(** Remark: this "splitting lemma for arrays" is useful to carry out local
    reasoning on arrays, by focusing on the segment of the array involved
    in each recursive call, and obtaining for free the fact that the
    cells outside of the segment remain unmodified. *)


(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Specification of the allocation of consecutive cells *)

(** The operation [val_alloc k] allocates [k] consecutive cells. Let [p]
    denote the pointer returned. The allocated cells have addresses in
    the range from [p] inclusive to [p+k] exclusive. These cells have for
    contents is the special value [val_uninit], which we assume to be part
    of the grammar of values. *)

Parameter val_uninit : val.

(** The heap produced by [val_alloc k] can be described by [harray L p],
    for a list [L] that consists of [k] occurences of the value [val_uninit].
    Such a list is formally described by [LibList.make k val_uninit].

    We introduce the heap predicate [harray_uninit k p] to denote the
    specialization of [harray] to that list. This predicate will appear
    in the postcondition of [val_alloc], as explained in the next section. *)

Definition harray_uninit (k:nat) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  harray (LibList.make k val_uninit) p.

(** Let us specify the behavior of the allocation function using a
    triple. We first state a specification with an argument of type [nat],
    then reformulate the specification with an argument of type [int].

    Consider a natural number [k]. Thanks to coercions, it may also be
    viewed as an integer value of type [val].

    The operation [val_alloc k] admits an empty precondition. Its
    postcondition asserts that the return value [r] is of the form
    [val_loc p] for some location [p], and that the final state
    satisfies the heap predicate [harray_uninit k p]. Recall that this
    predicate describes [k] cells at consecutive addresses starting from
    location [p], with uninitialized contents. *)

Parameter triple_alloc_nat : forall k,
  triple (val_alloc k)
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists p, \[r = val_loc p] \* harray_uninit k p).

(** We next generalize this specification so that it can handle applications
    of the form [val_alloc n], where [n] is of type [int], and can be proved
    to be nonnegative. (Such a formulation avoids the need to exhibit the
    natural number that corresponds to the value [n].)

    The new specification, shown below, features the premise [n >= 0]. Its
    postcondition involves the predicate [hcells (abs n) p], where [abs]
    converts a nonnegative [int] value into the corresponding [nat] value. *)

Lemma triple_alloc : forall n,
  n >= 0 ->
  triple (val_alloc n)
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists p, \[r = val_loc p] \* harray_uninit (abs n) p).
Proof using.

Qed.

(** The specification of the allocation function can be specialized to
    allocate arrays. To that end, we reformulate the postcondition of
    [val_alloc n] so that it exhibits a predicate of the form [harray L p],
    where [L] is of length [n]. We could specify that the values in [L]
    are all equal to [val_uninit], but for most applications it suffices
    to drop this information, and simply quantifying over an abstract list
    [L] of length [n]. *)

Lemma triple_alloc_array : forall n,
  n >= 0 ->
  triple (val_alloc n)
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists p L, \[r = val_loc p] \* \[n = length L] \* harray L p).

(** ** Specification of the deallocation of consecutive cells *)

(** The deallocation operation [val_dealloc n p] deallocates [n]
    consecutive cells starting from the location [p]. It admits the
    precondition [harray L p], where [L] can be any list of length [n],
    and its postcondition is empty. *)

Parameter triple_dealloc_harray : forall L n p,
  n = length L ->
  triple (val_dealloc n p)
    (harray L p)
    (fun _ => \[]).

(** Remark: in the C programming language, the argument [n] needs not be
    provided, because the system keeps track of the size of allocated blocks.
    One aspect that our simple semantics does not take into account is that
    in C one can invoke the deallocation function on pointers that were
    produced by the allocation function. We discuss further in this chapter
    a possible refinement of the specification to enforce this policy. *)

(** Above, the precondition [harray L p] is stronger than it needs to be.
    It would suffices to take [hcells L p] in the precondition. Depending
    on the use case, it may be easier for the user to not carry around the
    information that [p <> null]. *)

Parameter triple_dealloc_hcells : forall L n p,
  n = length L ->
  triple (val_dealloc n p)
    (hcells L p)
    (fun _ => \[]).

(** This second specification is still somewhat inconvenient for practical
    proofs. The reason is that it requires explicitly providing the list
    describing the contents of the deallocated cells. (An example illustrating
    the issue is given further on, in lemma [triple_dealloc_mcell].)

    We therefore consider an alternative deallocation rule that avoids the
    quantification over thie list [L]. It is based on a new heap predicate,
    written [hcells_any k p], which describes the contents of [k] cells,
    each of which with an arbitrary contents described through an existential
    quantifier. *)

Fixpoint hcells_any (k:nat) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  match k with
  | O => \[]
  | S k' => (\exists v, p ~~> v) \* (hcells_any k' (S p))
  end.

(** We can prove that the predicate [hcells_any k p] entails [hcells L p]
    for some list [L]. The list [L] is obtained by gathering the [k] existentially
    quantified values that appear recursively in the definition of [hcells_any]. *)

Qed.

(** The specification of the operation [val_dealloc k] can then be reformulated
    using a precondition of the forme [harray_any k p]. *)

(** ** Specification of array access operations *)

Module Arrays.

(** The operation [val_array_get p i] returns the contents of the [i]-th
    cell of the array at location [p]. *)

Parameter val_array_get : val.

(** The specification of [val_array_get] is as follows. The precondition
    describes the array in the form [harray L p], with a premise that
    requires the index [i] to be in the valid range, that is, between
    zero (inclusive) and the length of [L] (exclusive). The postcondition
    asserts that the result value is [nth (abs i) L], and mentions
    the unmodified array, still described by [harray L p]. *)

Parameter triple_array_get : forall L p i,
  0 <= i < length L ->
  triple (val_array_get p i)
    (harray L p)
    (fun r => \[r = LibList.nth (abs i) L] \* harray L p).

(** The operation [val_array_set p i v] updates the contents of the [i]-th
    cell of the array at location [p]. *)

Parameter val_array_set : val.

(** Again, for stating the specification, we axiomatize the corresponding
    operation on lists: [list_update L i v] describes the update to the
    list [L] by replacing the value at index [i] with the value [v]. *)

(** The specification of [val_array_set] admits the same precondition as
    [val_array_get], with [harray L p] and the constraint [0 <= i < length L].
    Its postcondition describes the updated array using a predicate of the
    form [harray L' p], where [L'] corresponds to [update (abs i) v L]. *)

Parameter triple_array_set : forall L p i v,
  0 <= i < length L ->
  triple (val_array_set p i v)
    (harray L p)
    (fun _ => harray (LibList.update (abs i) v L) p).

Hint Resolve triple_array_get triple_array_set : triple.

End Arrays.


(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Representation of a record field *)

(** A record can be represented as a set of fields stored in consecutive
    addresses.

    For example, consider a mutable list cell allocated at location [p].
    It consists of a record with a [head] field storing a value [x], and
    a tail field storing a value [q]. This list cell an be represented by
    the heap predicate [(p ~~> x) \* ((p+1) ~~> q)].

    If we define [head := 0] and [tail := 1], the same heap predicate can
    be written [((p+head) ~~> x) \* ((p+tail) ~~> q)].

    To better suggest that we are talking about record fields, and also to
    abstract away from the details of pointer arithmetics, we introduce the
    notation [p`.k ~~> v] to denote [(p+k) ~~> v]. Here, [k] denotes by
    convention a field name, where field names correspond to a natural
    numbers. In first approximation, the definition is shown below. *)

Definition field : Type := nat.

Definition hfield' (p:loc) (k:field) (v:val) : hprop :=
  (p+k)%nat ~~> v.

(** It is convenient in verification proofs to be able to assume that
    whenever we write [p`.k ~~> v], we refer to a location [p] that is
    not null. For an example, see the use of the lemma [hfield_not_null]
    inside the proof of the lemma [MList_if] in file [SLFBasic.v].

    To enable justifying this lemma [hfield_not_null], whose statement
    appears below, we bake in the definition of [p`.k ~~> v] the fact that
    [p] is not null, using the assertion [\[p <> null]]. *)

Definition hfield (p:loc) (k:field) (v:val) : hprop :=
  (p+k)%nat ~~> v \* \[p <> null].

Notation "p `. k '~~>' v" := (hfield p k v)
  (at level 32, k at level 0, no associativity,
   format "p `. k  '~~>'  v").

(** The lemma [hfield_not_null] asserts that the heap predicate [p`.k ~~> v]
    always ensures [p <> null]. *)

Lemma hfield_not_null : forall p k v,
  (p`.k ~~> v) ==> (p`.k ~~> v) \* \[p <> null].
Proof using. intros. unfold hfield. xsimpl*. Qed.

(** To prevent undesirable simplifications, we set the definition [hfield]
    to be opaque. Then, we provide a lemma for unfolding its definition.
    We replace the addition [p+k] with the addition [k+p], because the later
    simplifies better in Coq when [k] is a constant. *)

Lemma hfield_eq : forall p k v,
  hfield p k v = ((k+p)%nat ~~> v \* \[p <> null]).

(** ** Allocation and deallocation of record fields *)

(** We can allocate a fresh mutable list cell by invoking the primitive
    operation [val_alloc] with argument [2]. Let us prove that the result,
    described by [hcell 2 p], can be also be viewed as the heap predicate
    [(p`.head ~~> val_uninit) \* (p`.tail ~~> val_uninit)],
    which describes the two fields of the record, with uninitialized

    [xapp (@triple_dealloc_hcells (x::(val_loc q)::nil))]. Instead,

(** ** Reading and writing in record fields *)

(** For reading and writing in record fields, we introduce the operations
    [val_get_field] and [val_set_field]. As we show in the bonus section
    of this chapter, these functions can be defined in terms of the
    operations [val_get] and [val_set], if we assume available a pointer
    addition operation.

    For the moment, let us simply axiomatize these operations, and state
    their specifications.

    The expression [val_get_field] has type [field -> val]. Given a field
    name [f] (of type [field], which is defined as [nat]), the expression
    [val_get_field f] denotes a value of type [val] that can be applied to
    an argument [p]. The specification of [val_get_field f p] follows the
    pattern of the specification of [val_get]. The precondition and the
    postcondition describe a field [p`.k ~~> v], and the result value [r]
    is specified to be equal to [v].

Module GroupedFields.

(** In our presentation of record fields, one has to write the
    fields one by one, for example a list cell takes the form:
    [p`.head ~~> x \* p`.tail ~~> q].

    It may be convenient to exploit a more compact description
    that factorizes the location [p]. The same list cell may be
    described as [hrecord `{ head := x; tail := p'} p].

    This factorized form has at least two practical benefits:

    - it is shorter when the location [p] is not a very short
      identifier;
    - it significantly decreases the number of star-separated
      items in the heap predicates, thereby increasing the speed
      of proof processing.

    It what follows, we present the generic definition of

    This predicate is defined by recursion on the list [L].
    If [L] is empty, it describes the empty heap predicate.

(** ** Curried functions of several arguments *)

Module CurriedFun.
Open Scope liblist_scope.
Implicit Types f : var.

(** We next give a quick presentation of the notation, lemmas and
    tactics involved in the manipulation of functions of several
    arguments. We focus here on the particular case of recursive
    functions with two arguments, to illustrate the principles.

    The lemmas for other arities can be found in the file [SLFExtra].
    One may attempt to generalize these definitions to handle
    arbitrary arities. Yet, to obtain an arity-generic treatment of
    functions, it is much simpler to work with primitive n-ary functions
    (i.e., functions that expects a list of variables, and that may be
    applied to a list of values). The treatment of these n-ary functions
    is beyond the scope of (the current version of) the course.

    So, let us focus on curried recursive functions of arity two.

    [val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t)] describes a value that corresponds to
    a recursive function [t] that expects two arguments [x1] and [x2].
    Observe that the inner function, the one that expects [x2], is not
    recursive, and that it is not a value but a term, because it may
    refer to the variable [x1] bound outside of it.

    We introduce the notation [VFix f x1 x2 := t] to generalize
    [VFix f x := t] to the case of functions of two arguments. *)

Notation "'VFix' f x1 x2 ':=' t" :=
  (val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t))
  (at level 69, f, x1, x2 at level 0,
  format "'VFix'  f  x1  x2  ':='  t").

(** An application of a function of two arguments takes the form
    [f v1 v2], which is actually parsed as [trm_app (trm_app f v1) v2].

    This expression is an application of a term to a value, and not of
    a value to a value. Thus, this expression cannot be evaluated using
    the rule [eval_app_fun]. We need a distinct rule for first evaluating
    the arguments of a function application to values, before we can
    evaluate the application of a value to a value.

    The rule [eval_app_arg] serves that purpose. To state it, we first
    need to characterize whether a term is a value or not, using the
    predicate [trm_is_val t] defined next. *)

Definition trm_is_val (t:trm) : Prop :=
  match t with trm_val v => True | _ => False end.

(** The statement of [eval_app_arg] then takes the following form.
    For an expression [trm_app t1 t2] where either [t1] or [t2] is
    not a value, it enables reducing both [t1] and [t2] to values,
    leaving a premise of the form [trm_app v1 v2], which is subject
    to the rule [eval_app_fun] for evaluating functions. *)

Parameter eval_app_arg : forall s1 s2 s3 s4 t1 t2 v1 v2 r,
  (~ trm_is_val t1 \/ ~ trm_is_val t2) ->
  eval s1 t1 s2 v1 ->
  eval s2 t2 s3 v2 ->
  eval s3 (trm_app v1 v2) s4 r ->
  eval s1 (trm_app t1 t2) s4 r.

(** Using this rule, we can establish an evaluation rule for the
    term [v0 v1 v2]. There, [v0] is a recursive function of two
    arguments named [x1] and [x2], the values [v1] and [v2] denote
    the corresponding arguments, and [f] denotes the name of the
    function available for making recursive calls from the body [t1].

    The key idea is that the behavior of [v0 v1 v2] is similar to
    that of the term [subst x2 v2 (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1))].
    We state this property using the predicate [eval_like], introduced
    in the chapter [SLFRules]. *)

Lemma eval_like_app_fix2 : forall v0 v1 v2 f x1 x2 t1,
  v0 = val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t1) ->

(** ** Primitive n-ary functions *)

Module PrimitiveNaryFun.

(** We next present an alternative treatment to functions of several
    arguments. The idea is to represent arguments using lists.

    On the one hand, the manipulation of lists adds a little bit of
    boilerplate. On the other hand, when using this representation, all
    the definitions and lemmas are inherently arity-generic, that is, they
    work for any number of arguments.

    We introduce the following short names for the lists types involved:
    [vars], [vals] and [trms]. These names are not only useful to improve
    conciseness, they also enable the set up of useful coercions, as we
    will detail shortly afterwards. *)

Definition vars : Type := list var.
Definition vals : Type := list val.
Definition trms : Type := list trm.

Implicit Types xs : vars.
Implicit Types vs : vals.
Implicit Types ts : trms.

(** We assume the grammar of terms and values to include primitive n-ary
    functions and n-ary applications, featuring list of arguments. Thereafter,
    for conciseness, we describe only the case of recursive functions. *)

Parameter val_fixs : var -> vars -> trm -> val.
Parameter trm_fixs : var -> vars -> trm -> trm.
Parameter trm_apps : trm -> trms -> trm.

(** The substitution function is a bit tricky to update for dealing with
    list of variables. A definition along the following lines works well.
    On the one hand, it prevents variables capture. On the other hand,
    it traverses recursively the list of arguments, in a way that is
    recognized as structurally recursive.

[[
    Fixpoint subst (y:var) (w:val) (t:trm) : trm :=
      let aux t := (subst y w t) in
      let aux_no_captures xs t := (If List.In y xs then t else aux t) in
      match t with
      | trm_fixs f xs t1 => trm_fixs f xs (If f = y then t1 else
                                            aux_no_captures xs t1)
      | trm_apps t0 ts => trm_apps (aux t0) (List.map aux ts)
      ...
     end.
]]

    For additional details, we refer to the implementation of CFML.
*)

(** The evaluation rules need to be updated accordingly. A n-ary function
    from the grammar of terms evaluates to the corresponding n-ary
    function from the grammar of values. For technical reasons, we
    need to ensure that the program is well-formed and that the list
    of arguments to the function is nonempty. Indeed, a function of
    zero arguments is not considered a function in our language.
    (Otherwise, such a function [f] would beta-reduce to its body
    as soon as it is defined, because it waits for no arguments.) *)

Parameter eval_fixs : forall m f xs t1,
  xs <> nil ->
  eval m (trm_fixs f xs t1) m (val_fixs f xs t1).

(** A n-ary application of a function to values takes the form
    [trm_apps (trm_val v0) ((trm_val v1):: .. ::(trm_val vn)::nil)].
    If the function [v0] is defined as [val_fixs f xs t1], where [xs]
    denotes the list [x1::x2::...::xn::nil], then the beta-reduction
    of the function application triggers the evaluation of the
    substitution [subst xn vn (... (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1)) ...)].

    To describe the evaluation rule in an arity-generic way, we need to
    introduce the list [vs] made of the values provided as arguments,
    that is, the list [v1::v2::..::vn::nil].

    With this list [vs], the n-ary application can then be written as the
    term [trm_apps (trm_val v0) (trms_vals vs)], where the operation
    [trms_vals] a list of terms into a list of values. *)

Coercion trms_vals (vs:vals) : trms :=
  LibList.map trm_val vs.

(** Note that we declare the operation [trms_vals] as a coercion, just
    like [trm_val] is a coercion. Doing so enables us to write a n-ary
    application in the form [v0 vs]. *)

(** To describe the iterated substitution
    [subst xn vn (... (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1)) ...)], we introduce
    the operation [substn xs vs t], which substitutes the variables [xs]
    with the values [vs] inside the [t]. It is defined recursively. *)

Fixpoint substn (xs:list var) (vs:list val) (t:trm) : trm :=
  match xs,vs with
  | x::xs', v::vs' => substn xs' vs' (subst x v t)
  | _,_ => t
  end.

(** This substitution operation is well-behaved only if the list [xs]
    and the list [vs] have the same lengths. It is also desirable for
    reasoning about the evaluation rule to guarantee that the list of
    variables [xs] contains variables distinct from each others and
    distinct from [f], and that the list [xs] is not empty.

    To formally capture all these invariants, we introduce the predicate
    [var_fixs f xs n], [n] denotes the number of arguments the function
    is being applied to (i.e., the length of the list [vs]). *)

Definition var_fixs (f:var) (xs:vars) (n:nat) : Prop :=
     LibList.noduplicates (f::xs)
  /\ length xs = n
  /\ xs <> nil.

(** The evaluation of a recursive function [v0] defined as [val_fixs f xs t1]
    on a list of arguments [vs] triggers the evaluation of the term
    [substn xs vs (subst f v0 t1)], same as [substn (f::xs) (v0::vs) t1].
    The evaluation rule is stated as follows, using the predicate [var_fixs]
    to enforce the appropriate invariants on the variable names. *)

(** The second change is to introduce the [wpgen] function in place of

    substitution context [List.combine (f::xs) (v0::vs)], which describes
    a list of pairs of type [list (var * val)].

    The statement of the lemma for [xwp] is as follows. We omit the proof

    of the allocation function through the lemma [triple_alloc_nat]. *)

Parameter triple_alloc_nat' : forall k,
  triple (val_alloc k)
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists p, \[r = val_loc p] \* harray_uninit k p).

(* TODO: rename l for p everywhere in the semantics *)

(** Like for other operations, this specification can be proved
    correct with respect to the semantics of the programming
    language. The allocation operation [val_alloc n] can be
    described as extending the state with a range of fresh
    consecutive cells.

    The evaluation rule below describes the behavior of [val_alloc].
    We write [LibList.make k val_uninit] for a list that repeats
    [k] times the value [val_uninit]. We write [Fmap.conseq p L]
    for a heap made of consecutive cells, starting at location [p],
    whose contents are described by the elements from the list [L].
    This heap is named [mb], and it extends the existing heap,
    which is named [ma]. *)

Parameter eval_alloc : forall k n ma mb p,
  mb = Fmap.conseq p (LibList.make k val_uninit) ->
  n = nat_to_Z k ->
  p <> null ->
  Fmap.disjoint ma mb ->
  eval ma (val_alloc (val_int n)) (Fmap.union mb ma) (val_loc p).

(** To verify the specification of allocation, the crux of the proof
    is to establish the lemma [harray_uninit_intro], which establishes
    that the heap built by [Fmap.conseq] in the rule [eval_alloc]
    satisfies the predicate [harray_uninit] that appears in the
    postcondition of [triple_alloc_nat].

    This lemma itself relies on an introduction lemma for [hcells],
    asserting that [Fmap.conseq p L] satisfies [hcells L p].

    The two lemmas involved are stated and proved below. It is not
    needed to follow through the proof details. *)

(** ** Definition of array operations using pointer arithmetics *)

Module ArrayOps.
Import SLFProgramSyntax.

(** For example, an array operation on the [i]-th cell of an array at
    location [p] can be implemented within our language, as the application
    of a read or write operation at the address [p+i].

    In order to reason about the read or write operation on a specific
    cell, we need to isolate this cell from the other cells of the array.
    Then, after the operation, we need to fold back to the view on the
    entire array.

    The isolation process is captured in a general way by the following
    "focus lemma". It reads as follows. Assume [harray L p] to initially
    describe the full array. The, the [k]-th cell can be isolated as a
    predicate [(p+k) ~~> v], where [v] denotes the [k]-th item of [L],
    that is [LibList.nth k L].

    What remains can be described using the magic wand operator as
    [((p+k) ~~> v) \-* (harray L p)], which captures the idea that when
    providing back the cell at location [p+k], one would regain the
    ownership of the full array. *)

Parameter harray_focus_read : forall k p v L,
  k < length L ->
  v = LibList.nth k L ->
  harray L p ==>
       ((p+k)%nat ~~> v)
    \* ((p+k)%nat ~~> v \-* harray L p).

(** The above focus lemma works for read operations but falls short for
    a write operation, because it imposes the array to be put back in
    its original form. It does not take into account the possibility
    to fold back the array with a modified contents for the cell at [p+k].

    This observation leads us to generalize the magic wand describing
    the rest of the array into the form:
    [\forall w, ((p+k)%nat ~~> w) \-* harray (LibList.update k w L) p],
    which indicates that for any new contents [w], the array can be folded
    back into [harray L' p], where [L'] denotes the update of the list [L]
    with [w] at location [k] (instead of [v]).

    We state and prove this general focus lemma as follows. *)
