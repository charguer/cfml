(** * Chapter in a rush *)

(** This chapter introduces support for reasoning about

    - mutable records,
    - mutable arrays,
    - n-ary functions (i.e., functions of several arguments).

    To allocate records and arrays, we introduce a new primitive operation,
    named [val_alloc], that allocates at once a set of memory cells with
    consecutive addresses.

    For example, applying [val_alloc] to the integer value [3] would return
    a pointer [p] together with the ownership of three cells: one at
    location [p], one at location [p+1], and one atlocation [p+2].
    This allocation model that exposes pointer arithmetics provides a way
    to model both records and arrays with minimal extension to the semantics
    of the programming language that we consider for the course.

    The cells allocated using [val_alloc] are assigned as contents a special
    value, named [val_uninit], to reflect for the fact that their contents has
    never been set. Remark: in OCaml, one must provide an initialization
    value explicitly, so there is no such thing as [val_uninit]; in JavaScript,
    [val_uninit] is called [undefined]; in Java, arrays are initialized with
    zeros; in C, uninitialized data should not be read---we could implement
    this policy in our languageby restricting the evaluation rule for the read
    operation, adding a premise of the form [v <> val_uninit] to the rule.

    Regarding n-ary functions, that is, there are three possible approaches:

    - native n-ary functions, e.g., [function(x, y) { t } ] in C syntax.
    - curried functions, e.g., [fun x => fun y => t] in OCaml syntax.
    - tupled functions, e.g., [fun (x,y) => t] in OCaml syntax.

    In this chapter, we present reasoning rules for curried functions,
    again because this choice requires minimal extension to the syntax and
    semantics of our language. (In constrast, CFML is based on n-ary native
    n-ary functions, which are more practical and more efficient from an
    engineering perspective.)

(** ** Representation of a set of consecutive cells *)

Module Cells.

(** An array of length [k] allocated at location [p] can be represented
    as a set of [k] consecutive cells starting from location [p]. In other
    words, the array cells have addresses from [p] inclusive to [p+k]
    inclusive. Just like records, arrays can be allocated using the
    [val_alloc] primitive operation, and read and write operations on
    array cells can be derived. *)

(** The contents of an array of length [k] can be represented by a list
    of values of length [k].

    The heap predicate [hcells L p] represents a consecutive set of cells
    starting at location [p] and whose elements are described by the list [L].

    On paper, we could write something along the lines of:
    [\bigstar_{x at index i in L} { (p+i) ~~> x }].

    In Coq, we can define this predicate by induction on the list [L], with
    the pointer being incremented by one unit at each cell, as follows.
*)

Fixpoint hcells (L:list val) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  match L with
  | nil => \[]
  | x::L' => (p ~~> x) \* (hcells L' (S p))
  end.

(** Given a heap predicate [hcells L p], one can deduce that [p] is not
    null, but only if the list [L] is not empty. In order to avoid in
    proofs the need to treat specially the case empty arrays, it is
    convenient to pack together with [hcells L p] the information [p <> null],
    reflecting the fact that no data can be allocated at the null location,
    not even an empty array.

    The heap predicate [harray L p] packs together [hcells L p] with the
    information that [p] is not null.
*)

Definition harray (L:list val) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  hcells L p \* \[p <> null].

Lemma harray_not_null : forall p L,
  L <> nil ->
  harray L p ==> harray L p \* \[p <> null].
Proof using. introv N. unfold harray. xsimpl*. Qed.

(** The operation [val_alloc k] allocates [k] consecutive cells. Let [p]
    denote the pointer returned. The allocated cells have addresses in
    the range from [p] inclusive to [p+k] exclusive. These cells have for
    contents is the special value [val_uninit], which we assume to be part
    of the grammar of values. *)

Parameter val_uninit : val.

(** The heap produced by [val_alloc k] can be described by [harray L p],
    for a list [L] that consists of [k] occurences of the value [val_uninit].
    Such a list is formally described by [LibList.make k val_uninit].

    We introduce the heap predicate [harray_uninit k p] to denote the
    specialization of [harray] to that list. This predicate will appear
    in the postcondition of [val_alloc], as explained in the next section. *)

Definition harray_uninit (k:nat) (p:loc) : hprop :=
  harray (LibList.make k val_uninit) p.


(* ####################################################### *)
(** ** Specification of the allocation of consecutive cells *)

(** Let us specify the behavior of the allocation function using a
    triple. We first state a specification with an argument of type [nat],
    then reformulate the specification with an argument of type [int].

    Consider a natural number [k]. Thanks to coercions, it may also be
    viewed as an integer value of type [val].

    The operation [val_alloc k] admits an empty precondition. Its
    postcondition asserts that the return value [r] is of the form
    [val_loc p] for some location [p], and that the final state
    satisfies the heap predicate [harray_uninit k p]. Recall that this
    predicate describes [k] cells at consecutive addresses starting from
    location [p], with uninitialized contents. *)

Parameter triple_alloc_nat : forall (k:nat),
  triple (val_alloc k)
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists p, \[r = val_loc p] \* harray_uninit k p).

(** We next generalize this specification so that it can handle applications
    of the form [val_alloc n], where [n] is of type [int], and can be proved
    to be nonnegative. (Such a formulation avoids the need to exhibit the
    natural number that corresponds to the value [n].)

    The new specification, shown below, features the premise [n >= 0]. Its
    postcondition involves the predicate [hcells (abs n) p], where [abs]
    converts a nonnegative [int] value into the corresponding [nat] value. *)

Lemma triple_alloc : forall (n:int),
  n >= 0 ->
  triple (val_alloc n)
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists p, \[r = val_loc p] \* harray_uninit (abs n) p).

(** The specification of the allocation function can be specialized to
    allocate arrays. To that end, we reformulate the postcondition of
    [val_alloc n] so that it exhibits a predicate of the form [harray L p],
    where [L] is of length [n]. We could specify that the values in [L]
    are all equal to [val_uninit], but for most applications it suffices
    to drop this information, and simply quantifying over an abstract list
    [L] of length [n]. *)

Lemma triple_alloc_array : forall n,
  n >= 0 ->
  triple (val_alloc n)

(** The deallocation operation [val_dealloc n p] deallocates [n]
    consecutive cells starting from the location [p]. It admits the
    precondition [harray L p], where [L] can be any list of length [n],
    and its postcondition is empty.*)

Parameter triple_dealloc : forall (L:list val) (n:int) (p:loc),
  n = length L ->
  triple (val_dealloc n p)
    (harray L p)
    (fun _ => \[]).

Admitted.
*)

(** Remark: in the C programming language, the argument [n] needs not be
    provided, because the system keeps track of the size of allocated blocks.
    One aspect that our simple semantics does not take into account is that
    in C one can invoke the deallocation function on pointers that were
    produced by the allocation function. We discuss further in this chapter
    a possible refinement of the specification to enforce this policy. *)


(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Definition of record fields *)

(** A record can be represented as a set of fields stored in consecutive
    addresses.

    For example, consider a mutable list cell allocated at location [p].
    It consists of a record with a [head] field storing a value [x], and
    a tail field storing a value [q]. This list cell an be represented by
    the heap predicate [(p ~~> x) \* ((p+1) ~~> q)].

    If we define [head := 0] and [tail := 1], the same heap predicate can
    be written [((p+head) ~~> x) \* ((p+tail) ~~> q)].

    To better suggest that we are talking about record fields, and also to
    abstract away from the details of pointer arithmetics, we introduce the
    notation [p`.k ~~> v] to denote [(p+k) ~~> v]. Here, [k] denotes by
    convention a field name, where field names correspond to a natural
    numbers.

    It is convenient in verification proofs to be able to assume that
    whenever we write [p`.k ~~> v], we refer to a location [p] that is
    not null. For an example, see the use of the lemma [hfield_not_null]
    inside the proof of the lemma [MList_if] in file [SLFBasic.v].

    To enable justifying this lemma [hfield_not_null], whose statement
    appears below, we bake in the definition of [p`.k ~~> v] the fact that
    [p] is not null, using the assertion [\[p <> null]].

    In the definition of [hfield] shown below, note that we write [k+p]
    instead of [p+k] to enable smoother simplications via the [simpl] tactic. *)

Definition field : Type := nat.

Definition hfield (p:loc) (k:field) (v:val) : hprop :=
  (k+p)%nat ~~> v \* \[p <> null].

Notation "p `. k '~~>' v" := (hfield p k v)
  (at level 32, k at level 0, no associativity,
   format "p `. k  '~~>'  v").

(** The lemma [hfield_not_null] asserts that the heap predicate [p`.k ~~> v]
    always ensures [p <> null]. *)

Lemma hfield_not_null : forall p k v,
  (p`.k ~~> v) ==> (p`.k ~~> v) \* \[p <> null].
Proof using. intros. unfold hfield. xsimpl*. Qed.

(** To prevent undesirable simplifications, we set the definition [hfield]
    to be opaque, and we provide a lemma for unfolding its definition where
    necessary. *)

  hfield l k v = ((k+l)%nat ~~> v \* \[l <> null]).

(** ** Allocation and deallocation of record fields *)

(** We can allocate a fresh mutable list cell by invoking the primitive
    operation [val_alloc] with argument [2]. Let us prove that the result,
    described by [hcell 2 p], can be also be viewed as the heap predicate
    [(p`.head ~~> val_uninit) \* (p`.tail ~~> val_uninit)],
    which describes the two fields of the record, with uninitialized
    contents. *)

(** ** Reading and writing in record fields *)

(** For reading and writing in record fields, we introduce the operations
    [val_get_field] and [val_set_field]. As we show further in this chapter,
    these functions can be defined in terms of the operations [val_get]
    and [val_set], if we assume available a pointer addition operation.
    For the moment, let us simply axiomatize these operations, and state
    their specifications.

    The expression [val_get_field] has type [field -> val]. Given a field
    name [f] (of type [field], which is defined as [nat]), the expression
    [val_get_field f] denotes a value of type [val] that can be applied to
    an argument [p]. The specification of [val_get_field f p] follows the
    pattern of the specification of [val_get]. The precondition and the
    postcondition describe a field [p`.k ~~> v], and the result value [r]
    is specified to be equal to [v].

(** ** Local reasoning with arrays *)

(** Consider the function [array_incr], which increments all the cells of
    an array of integer by one unit.

    An efficient, parallel version of this function can be implemented using
    a divide-and-conquer approach: if the array has length more than [1],
    then split in two parts and make a recursive call on each of the two parts.
    The two recursive calls can be safely executed in parallel, because they
    act over disjoint pieces of the array. Our programming language does not
    enable us to express this form of parallelism, yet it would be possible
    to do so using a simple extension based on the "fork-join" parallel construct.

[[
    let rec array_incr_par n p =
      if n = 1 then incr p
      else if n > 1 then
        let m = n/2 in

(** The description of an array, that is, a set of consecutive cells,

(** ** Curried functions of several arguments *)

Module CurriedFun.

(** We next give a quick presentation of the notation, lemmas and
    tactics involved in the manipulation of functions of several
    arguments. We focus here on the particular case of recursive
    functions with two arguments, to illustrate the principles.

    The lemmas for other arities can be found in the file [SLFExtra].
    One may attempt to generalize these definitions to handle
    arbitrary arities. Yet, to obtain an arity-generic treatment of
    functions, it is much simpler to work with primitive n-ary functions
    (i.e., functions that expects a list of variables, and that may be
    applied to a list of values). The treatment of these n-ary functions
    is beyond the scope of (the current version of) the course.

    So, let us focus on curried recursive functions of arity two.

    [val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t)] describes a value that corresponds to
    a recursive function [t] that expects two arguments [x1] and [x2].
    Observe that the inner function, the one that expects [x2], is not
    recursive, and that it is not a value but a term, because it may
    refer to the variable [x1] bound outside of it.

    We introduce the notation [VFix f x1 x2 := t] to generalize
    [VFix f x := t] to the case of functions of two arguments. *)

Notation "'VFix' f x1 x2 ':=' t" :=
  (val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t))
  (at level 69, f, x1, x2 at level 0,
  format "'VFix'  f  x1  x2  ':='  t").

(** An application of a function of two arguments takes the form
    [f v1 v2], which is actually parsed as [trm_app (trm_app f v1) v2].

    This expression is an application of a term to a value, and not of
    a value to a value. Thus, this expression cannot be evaluated using
    the rule [eval_app_fun]. We need a distinct rule for first evaluating
    the arguments of a function application to values, before we can
    evaluate the application of a value to a value.

    The rule [eval_app_arg] serves that purpose. To state it, we first
    need to characterize whether a term is a value or not, using the
    predicate [trm_is_val t] defined next. *)

Definition trm_is_val (t:trm) : Prop :=
  match t with trm_val v => True | _ => False end.

(** The statement of [eval_app_arg] then takes the following form.
    For an expression [trm_app t1 t2] where either [t1] or [t2] is
    not a value, it enables reducing both [t1] and [t2] to values,
    leaving a premise of the form [trm_app v1 v2], which is subject
    to the rule [eval_app_fun] for evaluating functions. *)

Parameter eval_app_arg : forall s1 s2 s3 s4 t1 t2 v1 v2 r,
  (~ trm_is_val t1 \/ ~ trm_is_val t2) ->
  eval s1 t1 s2 v1 ->
  eval s2 t2 s3 v2 ->
  eval s3 (trm_app v1 v2) s4 r ->
  eval s1 (trm_app t1 t2) s4 r

(** Using this rule, we can establish an evaluation rule for the
    term [v0 v1 v2]. There, [v0] is a recursive function of two
    arguments named [x1] and [x2], the values [v1] and [v2] denote
    the corresponding arguments, and [f] denotes the name of the
    function available for making recursive calls from the body [t1].

    The key idea is that the behavior of [v0 v1 v2] is similar to
    that of the term [subst x2 v2 (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1))]. *)

Parameter triple_app_fix2 : forall f x1 x2 v0 v1 v2 t1 H Q,
  v0 = val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t1) ->
  (x1 <> x2 /\ f <> x2) ->
  triple (subst x2 v2 (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1))) H Q ->
  triple (v0 v1 v2) H Q.

(** The bonus section contains additional information on how to
    extend the [xwp] tactic to exploit this evaluation rule. *)

Moduled GroupedFields.

(** In our presentation of record fields, one has to write the
    fields one by one, for example a list cell takes the form:

    It may be convenient to exploit a more compact description
    that factorizes the location [p]. The same list cell may be

    This factorized form has at least two practical benefits:

    - it is shorter when the location [p] is not a very short
      identifier;
    - it significantly decreases the number of star-separated
      items in the heap predicates, thereby increasing the speed
      of proof processing.

    It what follows, we present the generic definition of
    [p ~> Record L], and suggest how the specification of
    the record field operations are set up.

    one fields the list of fields [L], where [L] has type
    [hrecord_fields], that is [list (field * val)].

    This predicate is defined by recursion on the list [L].
    If [L] is empty, it describes the empty heap predicate.
    Otherwise, a first field, at offset [f] and with contents [v],
    is describes by the predicate [p`.f ~~> v], then the remaining
    fields are described recursively. *)

Module CurriedFunXwp.

(** We next explain how to generalize the tactic [xwp] to handle
    recursive functions of two arguments. (For other arities, we
    refer to the file [SLFExtra.v].)

    As we said earlier, the key idea is that the behavior of [v0 v1 v2]
    is similar to that of the term [subst x2 v2 (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1))].

    We state this property using the predicate [eval_like], introduced
    in the chapter [SLFRules]. *)

Lemma eval_like_app_fix2 : forall v0 v1 v2 f x1 x2 t1,
  v0 = val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t1) ->
  (x1 <> x2 /\ f <> x2) ->
  eval_like (subst x2 v2 (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1))) (v0 v1 v2).
Proof using.
  introv E (N1&N2). introv R. applys* eval_app_arg.
  { applys eval_app_fix E. simpl. do 2 (rewrite var_eq_spec; case_if).
    applys eval_fun. }
  { applys* eval_val. }
  { applys* eval_app_fun. }
Qed.

(** From this result, we can easily prove the specification triple
    presented earlier on for applications of the form [v0 v1 v2]. *)

Lemma triple_app_fix2 : forall f x1 x2 v0 v1 v2 t1 H Q,
  v0 = val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t1) ->
  (x1 <> x2 /\ f <> x2) ->
  triple (subst x2 v2 (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1))) H Q ->
  triple (v0 v1 v2) H Q.
Proof using.
  introv E N M1. applys triple_eval_like M1. applys* eval_like_app_fix2.
Qed.

(** We can exploit the same result to esablish the corresponding
    weakest-precondition style version of the reasoning rule. *)

Lemma wp_app_fix2 : forall f x1 x2 v0 v1 v2 t1 Q,
  v0 = val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t1) ->
  (x1 <> x2 /\ f <> x2) ->
  wp (subst x2 v2 (subst x1 v1 (subst f v0 t1))) Q ==> wp (trm_app v0 v1 v2) Q.
Proof using. introv EQ1 N. applys wp_eval_like. applys* eval_like_app_fix2. Qed.

(** We can then reformulate this wp-style rule in a way that suits
    the needs of the [xwp] tactic, using a conclusion expressed
    using a [triple], and using a premise expressed using [wpgen].
    Observe the substitution context, which is instantiated as
    [(f,v0)::(x1,v1)::(x2,v2)::nil]. Note also how the side-conditions
    expressing the fact that the variables are distinct are stated
    using a comparison function for variables that computes in Coq. *)

Lemma xwp_lemma_fix2 : forall f v0 v1 v2 x1 x2 t H Q,
  v0 = val_fix f x1 (trm_fun x2 t) ->
  (var_eq x1 x2 = false /\ var_eq f x2 = false) ->
  H ==> wpgen ((f,v0)::(x1,v1)::(x2,v2)::nil) t Q ->
  triple (v0 v1 v2) H Q.
Proof using.
  introv M1 N M2. repeat rewrite var_eq_spec in N. rew_bool_eq in *.
  rewrite <- wp_equiv. xchange M2.
  xchange (>> wpgen_sound (((f,v0)::nil) ++ ((x1,v1)::nil) ++ ((x2,v2)::nil)) t Q).
  do 2 rewrite isubst_app. do 3 rewrite <- subst_eq_isubst_one.
  applys* wp_app_fix2.
Qed.

(** Finally, we can generalize the [xwp] tactic by integrating in
    its implementation an attempt to invoke the above lemma. *)

(** The generalized version of [xwp] following this line is

    in several examples from the chapter [SLFBasic]. *)
