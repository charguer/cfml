(** * The chapter in a rush *)

(** This chapter introduces additional Separation Logic operators,
    most notably the "magic wand", written [H1  \-* H2].

    Magic wand does not only have a cool name, and it is not only
    a fascinating operator for logicians: it turns out that the 
    magic wand is a key ingredient to streamlining the process of
    practical program verification in Separation Logic. 

    In this chapter, we first introduce the new operators, then
    explain how they can be used to reformulate the frame rule
    and give a different presentation to Separation Logic triples. *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Definition of the magic wand *)

(** At a high level, [H1 \* H2] describes the "addition" of a
    heap satisfying [H1] with a heap satisfying [H2]. 
    Think of it as [H1 + H2].

    As a counterpart to this addition operator, we introduce
    a subtraction operator, written [H1 \-* H2]. 
    Think of it as [ -H1 + H2].

    A heap [h] satisfies [H1 \-* H2] if and only if, when we augment
    it with a disjoint heap [h'] satisfying [H1], we recover [H2].
    Think of it as [(-H1 + H2) + H1] simplifying to [H2].

    The definition of [hwand] follows. *)

Definition hwand (H1 H2:hprop) : hprop :=
  fun h => forall h', fmap_disjoint h h' -> H1 h' -> H2 (h \u h').

Notation "H1 \-* H2" := (hwand H1 H2) (at level 43, right associativity).

(** The definition of [hwand] is not easy to make sense of at first.
    To better grasp its meaning, we next present two alternative
    definitions of [hwand], and detail its introduction and elimination
    lemmas. *)

(** The operator [H1 \-* H2] is uniquely defined by the followig
    equivalence. In other words, any operator that satisfies this
    equivalence for all arguments is provably equal to the definition 
    of [hwand] given above. (We proof this fact further in the chapter.) *)

Parameter hwand_equiv : forall H0 H1 H2,
  (H0 ==> H1 \-* H2) <-> (H0 \* H1 ==> H2).

(** The right-to-left direction is an introduction rule: it tells
    what needs to be proved to introduce a magic wand [H1 \-* H2]
    when starting from a state described by [H0]. What needs to
    be proved is that [H0], if augmented with [H1], yields [H2]. *)

Lemma hwand_intro : forall H0 H1 H2,
  (H0 \* H1) ==> H2 ->
  H0 ==> (H1 \-* H2).
Proof using. introv M. applys hwand_equiv. applys M. Qed.

(** The left-to-right direction is an elimination rule: it tells
    what can be deduced from [H0 ==> (H1 \-* H2)]. What can be
    deduced is that if [H0] is augmented with [H1], then [H2]
    can be recovered. *)

Lemma hwand_elim : forall H0 H1 H2,
  H0 ==> (H1 \-* H2) ->
  (H0 \* H1) ==> H2.
Proof using. introv M. applys hwand_equiv. applys M. Qed.

(** This elimination rule can be equivalently reformulated in the
    following form, which makes it perhaps even clearer that 
    [H1 \-* H2], when augmented with [H1], yields [H2].
    Think of it as [H1 + (-H1 + H2)] simplifying to [H2]. *)

Lemma hwand_cancel : forall H1 H2,
  H1 \* (H1 \-* H2) ==> H2.
Proof using.
  intros. rewrite hstar_comm.
  applys hwand_elim. applys himpl_refl.
Qed.

(** Another possible definition of [H1 \-* H2] can be stated
    without refering to heaps at all, by reusing the basic
    Separation Logic operators that we have already introduced.
    [H1 \-* H2] denotes some heap, described as [H0], such 
    that [H0] augmented with [H1] yields [H2].

    In the alternative definition of [hwand] shown below,
    the heap [H0] is existentially quantified using [\exists],
    and the entailment assertion is described as the pure heap
    predicate [\[ H0 \* H1 ==> H2 ]]. *)

Definition hwand' (H1 H2:hprop) : hprop :=
  \exists H0, H0 \* \[ (H0 \* H1) ==> H2].

(** As we prove further in this file, we can prove that [hwand']
    defines the same operator as [hwand]. *)

Parameter hwand_eq_hwand' :
  hwand = hwand'.

(** In practice, [SepBase] relies on the definition of [hwand'],
    which has the benefit that all properties of [hwand] can be
    established with help of the tactic [hsimpl]. In other words,
    we reduce the amount of work by conducting all the reasoning
    at the level of [hprop] and avoiding the need to work with
    explicit heaps (of type [heap]). *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Properties of the magic wand *)

(** We next present the most important properties of [H1 \-* H2].
    The tactic [hsimpl] provides dedicated support for
    simplifying expressions involving magic wand. So,
    in most proofs, it is not required to manually manipulate
    the lemmas capturing properties of the magic wand.
    Nevertheless, there are a few situations where [hsimpl]
    won't automatically perform the desired manipulation.
    Morover, reading the properties of [hwand] may help providing
    a better understanding of this operator. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Structural properties of [hwand] *)

(** [H1 \-* H2] is covariant in [H2], and contravariant in [H1]
    (like an implication). *)

Lemma himpl_hwand : forall H1 H1' H2 H2',
  H1' ==> H1 ->
  H2 ==> H2' ->
  (H1 \-* H2) ==> (H1' \-* H2').
Proof using.
  introv M1 M2. applys hwand_intro. hchange M1.
  hchange (@hwand_cancel H1 H2). applys M2.
Qed.

(** Two predicates [H1 \-* H2] ans [H2 \-* H3] may simplify
    to [H1 \-* H3]. This simplification is reminiscent of the
    arithmetic operation [(-H1 + H2) + (-H2 + H3) = (-H1 + H3)]. *)

Lemma hwand_trans_elim : forall H1 H2 H3,
  (H1 \-* H2) \* (H2 \-* H3) ==> (H1 \-* H3).
Proof using.
  intros. applys hwand_intro. hchange (@hwand_cancel H1 H2).
  hchange (@hwand_cancel H2 H3).
Qed.

(** The predicate [H \-* H] holds of the empty heap.
    Intuitively [(-H + H)] can be replaced with zero. *)

Lemma himpl_hempty_hwand_same : forall H,
  \[] ==> (H \-* H).
Proof using. intros. apply hwand_intro. hsimpl. Qed.


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Tempting but false properties for [hwand] *)

(** The reciprocal entailment to the above lemma, that is
    [(H \-* H) ==> \[]], does not hold.

    For example, [\Top \-* \Top] is a heap predicate that
    holds of any heap, and not just of the empty heap. *)

Lemma not_hwand_self_himpl_hempty : exists H,
  ~ ((H \-* H) ==> \[]).
Proof using.
  exists \Top. intros M.
  lets (h&N): (@fmap_exists_not_empty val). { typeclass. }
  forwards K: M h. { hnf. intros h' D K'. applys htop_intro. }
  false* (hempty_inv K).
Qed.

(** Likewise, the reciprocal entailment to the elimination 
    lemma, that is, [H2 ==> H1 \* (H1 \-* H2)] does not hold.

    As counter-example, consider [H2 = \[]] and [H1 = \[False]]. 
    We can prove that the empty heap does not satisfies 
    [\[False] \* (\[False] \-* \[])]. *)

Lemma not_hwand_elim_reciprocal : exists H1 H2,
  ~ (H2 ==> H1 \* (H1 \-* H2)).
Proof using. 
  exists \[False] \[]. intros N. forwards K: N (fmap_empty:heap).
  applys hempty_intro. rewrite hstar_hpure in K. destruct K. auto.
Qed.

(** More generally, one has to be suspicious of any entailment
    that introduces wands out of nowhere.

    The entailment [hwand_trans_elim]:
    [(H1 \-* H2) \* (H2 \-* H3) ==> (H1 \-* H3)]
    is correct because, intuitively, the left-hand-side captures
    that [H1 <= H2] and that [H1 <= H3] (for some vaguely-defined
    notion of [<=]), from which one derive [H1 <= H3] and justify
    that the right-hand-side makes sense.

    On the contrary, the reciprocal entailment
    [(H1 \-* H3) ==> (H1 \-* H2) \* (H2 \-* H3)]
    is certainly false, because from [H1 <= H3] there is no way
    to justify [H1 <= H2] nor [H2 <= H3]. *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Interaction of [hwand] with [hempty] and [hpure] *)

(** [\[] \-* H] is the same as [H]. *)

Lemma hwand_hempty_l : forall H,
  (\[] \-* H) = H.
Proof using.
  intros. rewrite hwand_eq_hwand'. unfold hwand'. hsimpl.
  { intros H0 M. hchange M. }
  { hsimpl. }
Qed.

(** Assume that [\[P] \-* H] holds of a heap.
    To show that [H] holds of this same heap, it suffices
    ot justify that the proposition [P] is true. Formally: *)

Lemma hwand_hpure_prove : forall P H,
  P ->
  \[P] \-* H ==> H.
Proof using.
  introv HP. rewrite hwand_eq_hwand'. unfold hwand'. hsimpl.
  intros H0 M. hchange M. applys HP.
Qed.
   (* Note: here is an alterntive proof w.r.t. [hwand]:
    introv HP. unfold hwand. intros h K.
    forwards M: K (fmap_empty:heap).
    { apply fmap_disjoint_empty_r. }
    { applys hpure_intro HP. }
    { rewrite fmap_union_empty_r in M. applys M. } *)

(** [\[P] \-* H] can be proved of a heap if [H] can be proved
   of this heap under the assumption [P]. Formally: *)

Lemma hwand_move_l_pure : forall H1 H2 P,
  (P -> H1 ==> H2) ->
  H1 ==> (\[P] \-* H2).
Proof using. introv M. applys hwand_intro. hsimpl. applys M. Qed.


(* ------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Interaction of [hwand] with [hstar] *)

(** The heap predicates [(H1 \* H2) \-* H3] and [H1 \-* (H2 \-* H3)]
    and [H2 \-* (H1 \-* H3)] are all equivalent. Intuitively, they all 
    describe the predicate [H3] with the missing pieces [H1] and [H2]. 

    The equivalence between the uncurried form [(H1 \* H2) \-* H3]
    and the curried form [H1 \-* (H2 \-* H3)] is formalized by the
    lemma shown below. The third form [H2 \-* (H1 \-* H3)] follows
    directly by exploiting the commutativity [H1 \* H2 = H2 \* H1]. *)

Lemma hwand_curry_eq : forall H1 H2 H3,
  (H1 \* H2) \-* H3 = H1 \-* (H2 \-* H3).
Proof using.
  intros. applys himpl_antisym.
  { apply hwand_intro. apply hwand_intro.
    hchange (@hwand_cancel (H1 \* H2) H3). }
  { apply hwand_intro. hchange (@hwand_cancel H1 (H2 \-* H3)).
    hchange (@hwand_cancel H2 H3). }
Qed.

(** Consider a heap that satisfies [(H1 \-* H2) \* H3].
    This heap consists of a part satisfying [H3], and a part that,
    if completed with a part satisfying [H1], would satisfy [H2].
    This same heap also satisfies [H1 \-* (H2 \* H3)], which
    describes a heap such, if completed with a part satisfying [H1],
    would decompose as a part satisfying [H2] and a part satisfying [H3].
    Formally: *)

Lemma hstar_hwand : forall H1 H2 H3,

(** *** Equivalence between the definitions of magic wand *)

(** In what follows we prove the equivalence between the three
    characterizations of [hwand H1 H2] that we have presented:

    1. [fun h => forall h', fmap_disjoint h h' -> H1 h' -> H2 (h \u h')]

    2. [\exists H0, H0 \* \[ (H0 \* H1) ==> H2]]

    3. [forall H0 H1 H2, (H0 ==> hwand H1 H2) <-> (H0 \* H1 ==> H2)].
