(** * Chapter in a rush *)

(** This chapter introduces additional Separation Logic operators,
    most notably the "magic wand", written [H1 \-* H2].

    Magic wand does not only have a cool name, and it is not only
    a fascinating operator for logicians; it turns out that the
    magic wand is a key ingredient to streamlining the process of
    practical program verification in Separation Logic.

    In this chapter, we first introduce the new operators, then
    explain how they can be used to reformulate the frame rule
    and give a different presentation to Separation Logic triples. *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Definition of the magic wand *)

(** At a high level, [H1 \* H2] describes the "addition" of a
    heap satisfying [H1] with a heap satisfying [H2].
    Think of it as [H1 + H2].

    As a counterpart to this addition operator, we introduce
    a subtraction operator, written [H1 \-* H2].
    Think of it as [ -H1 + H2].

    A heap [h] satisfies [H1 \-* H2] if and only if, when we augment
    it with a disjoint heap [h'] satisfying [H1], we recover [H2].
    Think of it as [(-H1 + H2) + H1] simplifying to [H2].

    The definition of [hwand] follows. *)

Definition hwand (H1 H2:hprop) : hprop :=
  fun h => forall h', Fmap.disjoint h h' -> H1 h' -> H2 (h \u h').

Notation "H1 \-* H2" := (hwand H1 H2) (at level 43, right associativity).

(** The definition of [hwand] is not easy to make sense of at first.
    To better grasp its meaning, we next present two alternative
    definitions of [hwand], and detail its introduction and elimination
    lemmas. *)

(** The operator [H1 \-* H2] is uniquely defined by the followig
    equivalence. In other words, any operator that satisfies this
    equivalence for all arguments is provably equal to the definition
    of [hwand] given above. (We proof this fact further in the chapter.) *)

Parameter hwand_equiv : forall H0 H1 H2,
  (H0 ==> H1 \-* H2) <-> (H0 \* H1 ==> H2).

(** The right-to-left direction is an introduction rule: it tells
    what needs to be proved to introduce a magic wand [H1 \-* H2]
    when starting from a state described by [H0]. What needs to
    be proved is that [H0], if augmented with [H1], yields [H2]. *)

Lemma himpl_hwand_r : forall H0 H1 H2,
  (H0 \* H1) ==> H2 ->
  H0 ==> (H1 \-* H2).
Proof using. introv M. applys hwand_equiv. applys M. Qed.

(** The left-to-right direction is an elimination rule: it tells
    what can be deduced from [H0 ==> (H1 \-* H2)]. What can be
    deduced is that if [H0] is augmented with [H1], then [H2]
    can be recovered. *)

Lemma himpl_hwand_r_inv : forall H0 H1 H2,
  H0 ==> (H1 \-* H2) ->
  (H0 \* H1) ==> H2.
Proof using. introv M. applys hwand_equiv. applys M. Qed.

(** This elimination rule can be equivalently reformulated in the
    following form, which makes it perhaps even clearer that
    [H1 \-* H2], when augmented with [H1], yields [H2].
    Think of it as [H1 + (-H1 + H2)] simplifying to [H2]. *)

Lemma hwand_cancel : forall H1 H2,
  H1 \* (H1 \-* H2) ==> H2.
Proof using.
  intros. rewrite hstar_comm.
  applys himpl_hwand_r_inv. applys himpl_refl.
Qed.

Arguments hwand_cancel : clear implicits.

(** Another possible definition of [H1 \-* H2] can be stated
    without refering to heaps at all, by reusing the basic
    Separation Logic operators that we have already introduced.
    [H1 \-* H2] denotes some heap, described as [H0], such
    that [H0] augmented with [H1] yields [H2].

    In the alternative definition of [hwand] shown below,
    the heap [H0] is existentially quantified using [\exists],
    and the entailment assertion is described as the pure heap
    predicate [\[ H0 \* H1 ==> H2 ]]. *)

Definition hwand' (H1 H2:hprop) : hprop :=
  \exists H0, H0 \* \[ (H0 \* H1) ==> H2].

(** As we prove further in this file, we can prove that [hwand']
    defines the same operator as [hwand]. *)

Parameter hwand_eq_hwand' :
  hwand = hwand'.

(** In practice, file [SLFDirect] relies on the definition [hwand'],
    which has the benefit that all properties of [hwand] can be
    established with help of the tactic [xsimpl]. In other words,
    we reduce the amount of work by conducting all the reasoning
    at the level of [hprop] and avoiding the need to work with
    explicit heaps (of type [heap]). *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Magic wand for postconditions *)

(** For entailment, written [H1 ==> H2], we introduced its extension
    to postconditions, written [Q1 ===> Q2], and defined as
    [forall x, (Q1 x) ==> (Q2 x)].

    Likewise, for magic wand, written [H1 \-* H2], we introduce
    its extension to postconditions, written [Q1 \--* Q2], and
    defined (in first approximation) as [forall x, (Q1 x) \-* (Q2 x)].

    Like [H1 \-* H2], the expression [Q1 \--* Q2] should denote a heap
    predicate, of type [hprop]. Thus, writing [forall x, (Q1 x) \-* (Q2 x)]
    makes no sense, because [forall] applies to propositions of type [Prop],
    and not to heap predicates of type [hprop].

    In order to define [Q1 \--* Q2], we thus need to introduce the
    operation [\forall], which lifts the universal quantifier from
    [Prop] to [hprop]. In other words, [\forall] is to [forall]
    what [\exists] is to [exists].

    The definition of [\forall x, H], a notation for [hforall (fun x => H)],
    follows exactly the same pattern as that of [\exists x, H], with only
    the [exists] quantifier being replaced with a [forall] in the definition. *)

Definition hforall (A : Type) (J : A -> hprop) : hprop :=
  fun h => forall x, J x h.

Notation "'\forall' x1 .. xn , H" :=
  (hforall (fun x1 => .. (hforall (fun xn => H)) ..))
  (at level 39, x1 binder, H at level 50, right associativity,
   format "'[' '\forall' '/ '  x1  ..  xn , '/ '  H ']'") : heap_scope.

(** We are now read to formally define [Q1 \--* Q2], a notation that stands
    for [qwand Q1 Q2], and which is defined as [\forall x, (Q1 x) \-* (Q2 x)]. *)

Definition qwand A (Q1 Q2:A->hprop) : hprop :=
  \forall x, (Q1 x) \-* (Q2 x).

Notation "Q1 \--* Q2" := (qwand Q1 Q2) (at level 43).

(** As a sanity check of our definition, let us prove that [Q1 \--* Q2]
    indeed entails [(Q1 x) \-* (Q2 x)] for any [x]. *)

Lemma qwand_specialize : forall A (x:A) (Q1 Q2:A->hprop),
  (Q1 \--* Q2) ==> (Q1 x \-* Q2 x).
Proof using. intros. unfold qwand. intros h K. applys K. Qed.

(** The operator [qwand] satisfies many properties similar to those
    of [hwand]. We state these properties further in the chapter.

    For now, we just state the two most important rules: the
    characterization rule, and the cancellation rule. *)

Lemma qwand_equiv : forall H Q1 Q2,
  H ==> (Q1 \--* Q2)  <->  (Q1 \*+ H) ===> Q2.
Proof using.
  intros. iff M.
  { intros x. xchange M. xchange (qwand_specialize x).
    xchange (hwand_cancel (Q1 x)). }
  { applys himpl_hforall_r. intros x. applys himpl_hwand_r.
    xchange (M x). }
Qed.

Lemma qwand_cancel : forall Q1 Q2,
  Q1 \*+ (Q1 \--* Q2) ===> Q2.
Proof using. intros. rewrite <- qwand_equiv. applys qimpl_refl. Qed.


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Frame expressed with [hwand]: the ramified frame rule *)

(** Recall the consequence-frame rule *)

Parameter triple_conseq_frame : forall H2 H1 Q1 t H Q,
  triple t H1 Q1 ->
  H ==> H1 \* H2 ->
  Q1 \*+ H2 ===> Q ->
  triple t H Q.

(** This rule suffers from practical issues, which we discuss in
    details further in this chapter. In short, the main problem is
    that one needs to either provide a value for, or to introduce a
    unification variable (evar) for [H2]. The problem would disappear
    if we make use of the magic wand to eliminate the need to quantify
    [H2] altogether.

    [Q1 \*+ H2 ===> Q] is equivalent to [H2 ==> (Q1 \--* Q)].
    By substituting away, we can merge the two entailments
    [H ==> H1 \* H2] and [H2 ==> (Q1 \--* Q)] into a single one:
    [H ==> H1 \* (Q1 \--* Q)].

    The resulting rule is called the "ramified frame rule". *)

Lemma triple_ramified_frame : forall H1 Q1 t H Q,
  triple t H1 Q1 ->
  H ==> H1 \* (Q1 \--* Q) ->
  triple t H Q.

(** As we prove next, the ramified frame rule has exactly the same
    expressive power as the consequence-frame rule.

    First, let us prove that it is derivable.
    To that end, we instantiate [H2] as [Q1 \--* Q]. *)

Proof using.
  introv M W. applys triple_conseq_frame (Q1 \--* Q) M.
  { applys W. } { applys qwand_cancel. }
Qed.

(** Reciprocally, we prove that consequence-frame is derivable from
    the ramified frame rule. *)

Lemma triple_conseq_frame' : forall H2 H1 Q1 t H Q,
  triple t H1 Q1 ->
  H ==> H1 \* H2 ->
  Q1 \*+ H2 ===> Q ->
  triple t H Q.

(** [xsimpl] is able to spot magic wand that cancel out.
    For example, [H2 \-* H3] can be simplified with [H2]
    to leave only [H3]. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_hwand_cancel_partial : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6,
  ((H1 \* H2 \* H3) \-* H4) \* H5 \* H2 ==> H6.
Proof using. intros. xsimpl. Abort.

(** [xsimpl] automatically applies the [himpl_hwand_r] when
    the right-hand-side, after prior simplification, reduces
    to just a magic wand. In the example below, [H1] is first
    cancelled out from both sides, then [H3] is moved from
    the RHS to the LHS. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_himpl_hwand_r : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 H5,
  H1 \* H2 ==> H1 \* (H3 \-* (H4 \* H5)).
Proof using. intros. xsimpl. Abort.

(** [xsimpl] iterates the simplifications it is able to perform

(** [xsimpl] is also able to deal with [qwand]. In particular,
    it can cancel out [Q1 \--* Q2] against [Q1 v], leaving [Q2 v]. *)

(** ** Limitation of [consequence-frame] *)

(** Recall the consequence-frame rule *)

Parameter triple_conseq_frame'' : forall H2 H1 Q1 t H Q,
  triple t H1 Q1 ->
  H ==> H1 \* H2 ->
  Q1 \*+ H2 ===> Q ->
  triple t H Q.

(** One practical caveat with this rule is that we must resolve [H2],
    which corresponds to the difference between [H] and [H1].
    In practice, providing [H2] explicitly is extremely tedious.
    The alternative is to leave [H2] as an evar, and count on the
    fact that the tactic [xsimpl], when applied to [H ==> H1 \* H2],
    will correctly instantiate [H2].

    This approach works, but is relatively fragile, as evars may get
    instantiated in undesired ways. Moreover, evars depend on the context
    at the time of their creation, and they must be instantiated with
    values from that context. Yet, for example, if [H] contains existential
    quantifiers at the moment of applying the consequence-frame rule,
    then extracting those quantifiers after the rule is applied makes
    it almost impossible to instantiate [H2] correctly.

    To illustrate the problem on a concrete example, recall the
    specification of [ref]. *)

Parameter triple_ref : forall (v:val),
  triple (val_ref v)
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists (l:loc), \[r = val_loc l] \* l ~~~> v).

(** Assume that wish to derive the following triple, which

  triple (val_ref v)

       from the LHS. After that, the instantiation of [H2] fails. *)
    xsimpl.
Abort.

(** Now, let us apply the ramified frame rule for the same goal. *)

Lemma triple_ref_with_nonempty_pre' : forall (v:val),

    Assume we want to frame the specification [triple_ref] with [l' ~~~> v'],
    that is, add this predicate to both the precondition and the postcondition.
    First, let's do it with the consequence-frame rule. *)

Lemma triple_ref_with_consequence_frame : forall (l':loc) (v':val) (v:val),

    (fun r => \exists (l:loc), \[r = val_loc l] \* l ~~~> v \* l' ~~~> v').

  { applys triple_ref. }
  { xsimpl. (* instantiates the evar [H2] *) }
  { xsimpl. auto. }
Qed.

(** Now, let's carry out the same proof using the ramified frame rule. *)

Lemma triple_ref_with_ramified_frame : forall (l':loc) (v':val) (v:val),

(** Again, observe how we have been able to complete the same proof
    without involving any evar. *)

(** ** Properties of [hwand] *)

(** We next present the most important properties of [H1 \-* H2].
    The tactic [xsimpl] provides dedicated support for
    simplifying expressions involving magic wand. So,
    in most proofs, it is not required to manually manipulate
    the lemmas capturing properties of the magic wand.
    Nevertheless, there are a few situations where [xsimpl]
    won't automatically perform the desired manipulation.
    In such cases, the tactic [xchange] proves very useful. *)

(** *** Structural properties of [hwand] *)

(** [H1 \-* H2] is covariant in [H2], and contravariant in [H1]

(** Two predicates [H1 \-* H2] ans [H2 \-* H3] may simplify

(** More generally, one has to be suspicious of any entailment

    The entailment [hwand_trans_elim]:

    is correct because, intuitively, the left-hand-side captures
    that [H1 <= H2] and that [H1 <= H3] (for some vaguely-defined
    notion of [<=]), from which one derive [H1 <= H3] and justify
    that the right-hand-side makes sense.

    On the contrary, the reciprocal entailment
    [(H1 \-* H3) ==> (H1 \-* H2) \* (H2 \-* H3)]

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Texan triples on a simple example *)

(** In this section, we show that specification triples can be presented
    in a different (yet equivalent) style using weakest preconditions. *)

(** Consider for example the specification triple for allocation. *)

Parameter triple_ref : forall v,
  triple (val_ref v)
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists (l:loc), \[r = val_loc l] \* l ~~~> v).

(** This specification can be equivalently reformulated in the form: *)

Parameter wp_ref : forall Q v,
  \[] \* (\forall l, l ~~~> v \-* Q (val_loc l)) ==> wp (val_ref v) Q.

(** Above, we purposely left the empty heap predicate to the front to
    indicate where the precondition, if it were not empty, would go in
    the reformulation. *)

(** In what follows, we describe the chain of transformation that can take us
    from the triple form to the wp form, and establish the reciprocal.
    We then formalize the general pattern for translating a triple
    into a "texan triple" (i.e., the wp-based specification). *)

(** By replacing [triple t H Q] with [H ==> wp t Q], the specification
    gets reformulated as: *)

    The value [v] may depend on the [xi].
    The heap predicate [H'] may depend on [r] and the [xi].
    The number of existentials [xi] may vary, possibly be zero.
    The equality \[r = v] may degenerate to \[r = r] if no pure fact
    is needed about [r].

    A triple of the above form may be reformulated as:
    [(\forall x1 x2, H \-* Q v) ==> wp t Q].

    We next formalize this result for the case of a single [xi] variable,
    making it explicit that [H] and [v] may depend on it. *)

(** * Recursive treatment of local function definitions *)

(** As mentioned in the section on the treatment of function definitions,
    it is possible to recursively invoke [wpgen] on the body of local
    function definitions. We next explain how. *)

Implicit Types vf vx : val.


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** WP for non-recursive functions *)

(** The definition of [wpgen] is modified so that [wpgen (trm x t1)]
    is no longer expressed in terms of [t1], but rather in terms of
    the formula produced by recursively computing [wpgen] on [t1].

    Recall that [wpgen (trm_fun x t1) Q] was previously defined as
    [wpgen_val (val_fun x t1) Q], that is, as [Q (val_fun x t1)].
    Here, we'd like to eliminate the reference to the code [t1].
    Let us introduce [vf], a variable that stands for [val_fun x t1],
    and reformulae the heap predicate [wpgen (trm_fun x t1) Q] from
    [Q (val_fun x t1)] to  [\forall vf, \[P vf] \-* (Q vf)], where
    [P vf] denotes some proposition that characterizes the function
    [val_fun x t1] in terms of its weakest precondition.

    The proposition [P vf] characterizes the function [vf] extensionally:
    it provides an hypothesis sufficient for reasoning about an application
    of the function [vf] to any argument [vx]. In other words, it provides
    a [wp] for [trm_app vf vx]. This [wp] is expressed in terms of the
    [wpgen] for [t1]. Concretely, [P vf] is defined as:
    [forall vx Q', (wpgen ((x,v)::E) t1) Q' ==> wp (trm_app vf vx) Q']. *)

(** Similarly to what is done for other constructs, we introduce an auxiliary
    function called [wpgen_fun] to isolate the logic of the definition from
    the recursive call on [t1]. The function of [wpgen] becomes:

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct match t with
    | ..
    | trm_fun x t1 =>
        wpgen_fun (fun v => wpgen ((x,v)::E) t1)
    | ..
    end
]]

   The definition of [wpgen_fun] appears next. *)

Definition wpgen_fun (Fof:val->formula) : formula := fun Q =>
  \forall vf, \[forall vx Q', Fof vx Q' ==> wp (trm_app vf vx) Q'] \-* Q vf.

(*
   \exists H, H \* \[forall vf,
                     (forall vx Q', Fof vx Q' ==> wp (trm_app vf vx) Q') ->
                      H ==> Q vf].


  Goal:   H0 ==> wpgen (trm_fun x t)
  unfolds to:
      H0 ==> \exists H, H \* \[forall vf,
                     (forall vx Q', Fof vx Q' ==> wp (trm_app vf vx) Q') ->
                      H ==> Q vf].
  simplifies to:

      forall vf,
      (forall vx H' Q',
          H' ==> Fof vx Q' ->
          triple (trm_app vf vx) H' Q') ->
      H0 ==> Q vf

  xfun_lemma:

(** ** Generalization to recursive functions *)

(** The discussion above generalizes almost directly to recursive functions.
    To compute [wpgen] of [trm_fix f x t1] in a context [E], the recursive
    call to [wpgen] extends the context [E] with two bindings, one for [f]
    and one for [x].

[[
  Fixpoint wpgen (E:ctx) (t:trm) : formula :=
    mkstruct match t with
    | ..
    | trm_fun x t1 =>
        wpgen_fix (fun vf v => wpgen ((f,vf)::(x,v)::E) t1)
    | ..
    end
]]

   The auxiliary function [wpgen_fix] is defined as follows.
   Observe how [vf] now occurs not only in [trm_app vf vx], but also
   in the formula [Fof vf vx] which describes the behavior of the
   recursive function. *)

Definition wpgen_fix (Fof:val->val->formula) : formula := fun Q =>
  \forall vf, \[forall vx Q', Fof vf vx Q' ==> wp (trm_app vf vx) Q'] \-* Q vf.

(** The corresponding soundness lemma for this construct appears next. *)

Lemma wpgen_fix_sound : forall f x t1 Fof,
  (forall vf vx, formula_sound (subst x vx (subst f vf t1)) (Fof vf vx)) ->
  formula_sound (trm_fix f x t1) (wpgen_fix Fof).
Proof using.
  introv M. intros Q. unfolds wpgen_fix. applys himpl_hforall_l (val_fix f x t1).
  xchange hwand_hpure_l_intro.
  { intros. applys himpl_trans_r. { applys* wp_app_fix. } { applys* M. } }
  { applys wp_fix. }
Qed.

(** When we carry out the proof of soundness (again, details for this proof
    may be found in file [SLFDirect.v]), we obtain a proof obligation for
    which we need a little generalization of [isubst_rem], called [isubst_rem_2]
    and stated next. (Its proof appears in [SLFDirect.v].) *)

Parameter isubst_rem_2 : forall f x vf vx E t,
  isubst ((f,vf)::(x,vx)::E) t = subst x vx (subst f vf (isubst (rem x (rem f E)) t)).

(** The proof of soundness is otherwise similar to that of non-recursive functions. *)

Lemma wpgen_fix_proof_obligation : forall E f x t1,
  (forall E, formula_sound (isubst E t1) (wpgen E t1)) ->
  formula_sound (trm_fix f x (isubst (rem x (rem f E)) t1))
                    (wpgen_fix (fun vf vx => wpgen ((f,vf)::(x,vx)::E) t1)).
Proof using.
  introv IH. applys wpgen_fix_sound.
  { intros vf vx. rewrite <- isubst_rem_2. applys IH. }
