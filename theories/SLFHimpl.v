(** * Chapter in a rush *)

(** In the previous chapter, we have introduced the key heap predicate
    operators, and we have defined the notion of Separation Logic triple.

    In order to be able to state and prove reasoning rules for establishing
    triples, we first need to introduce the "entailement relation",
    written [H1 ==> H2], and asserting that any heap satisfying [H1] also
    satisfies [H2].

    This entailement relation defines an order relation on heap predicates.

    By extension, we define an entailement relation on postconditions,
    written [Q1 ===> Q2], asserting that, for any result value [v],
    the entailement [Q1 v ==> Q2 v] holds.

    For example, the two kind of entailments appear in the statement of
    the rule of consequence, similar to that from Hoare logic:

[[
    Lemma triple_conseq : forall t H Q H' Q',
      triple t H' Q' ->
      H ==> H' ->
      Q' ===> Q ->
      triple t H Q.
]]

   This chapter presents:
   - the definition of the entailment relations,
   - the fundamental properties of the Separation Logic operators
     (these properties are expressed either as entailments or as
     equalities, which denote symmetric entailments),
   - the 4 structural rules of Separation Logic: the rule of consequence,
     the frame rule (which can be combined with the rule of consequence),
     and the extractions rules for pure facts and for quantifiers,
   - the tactics [xsimpl] and [xchange] that are critically useful
     for manipulating entailments in practice,
   - (optional) details on how to prove the fundamental properties
     and the structural rules.

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Definition of entailment *)

(** The "entailement relationship" [H1 ==> H2] asserts that any
    heap satisfying [H1] also satisfies [H2]. *)

Definition himpl (H1 H2:hprop) : Prop :=
  forall (h:heap), H1 h -> H2 h.

Notation "H1 ==> H2" := (himpl H1 H2) (at level 55).

(** [H1 ==> H2] captures the fact that [H1] is a stronger precondition
    than [H2], in the sense that it is more restrictive. *)

(** As we show next, the entailment relation is reflexive, transitive,
    and antisymmetric. It thus forms an order relation on heap predicates. *)

Lemma himpl_refl : forall H,
  H ==> H.
Proof using. intros h. hnf. auto. Qed.

Lemma himpl_trans : forall H2 H1 H3,
  (H1 ==> H2) ->
  (H2 ==> H3) ->
  (H1 ==> H3).
Proof using. introv M1 M2. intros h H1h. eauto. Qed.

(* EX1! (himpl_antisym) *)
(** Prove the antisymmetry of entailement result shown below
    using extensionatity for heap predicates, as captured by
    lemma [predicate_extensionality] (or lemma [hprop_eq])
    introduced in the previous chapter ([SLFHprop]). *)

Lemma himpl_antisym : forall H1 H2,
  (H1 ==> H2) ->
  (H2 ==> H1) ->
  H1 = H2.
Proof using. (* ADMITTED *)
  introv M1 M2. applys hprop_eq.
  intros h. iff N.
  { applys M1. auto. }
  { applys M2. auto. }
Qed. (* /ADMITTED *)

(** [] *)

(** For example, [himpl_antisym] can be used to establish
    commutativity of separating conjunction: [(H1 \* H2) = (H2 \* H1)]
    by proving that each side entails the other:
    [(H1 \* H2) ==> (H2 \* H1)] and [(H2 \* H1) ==> (H1 \* H2)].
    Such a proof appears further on. *)

(** Remark: as the proofs suggest, the fact that entailment on [hprop] constitute an
    order relation is a direct consequence of the fact that implication on [Prop],
    (that is, [->]) is an order relation on [Prop] (when assuming the propositional
    extensionality axiom). *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Entailment for postconditions *)

(** The entailment [==>] relates heap predicates. It is used to capture
    that a precondition is stronger than another one (i.e., that a
    precondition entails another one). It is similarly interesting to
    express that a postcondition is stronger than another one.

    For that purpose, we introduce [Q1 ===> Q2], which asserts that
    for any value [v], the heap predicate [Q1 v] entails [Q2 v].

    Equivalently, [Q1 ===> Q2] holds if for any value [v] and any heap [h],
    the proposition [Q1 v h] implies [Q2 v h]. *)

Definition qimpl (Q1 Q2:val->hprop) : Prop :=
  forall (v:val), Q1 v ==> Q2 v.

Notation "Q1 ===> Q2" := (qimpl Q1 Q2) (at level 55).

(** Entailment on postconditions also forms an order relation: it is reflexive,
    transitive, and antisymetric. *)

Lemma qimpl_refl : forall Q,
  Q ===> Q.
Proof using. intros Q v. applys himpl_refl. Qed.

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Fundamental properties of Separation Logic operators *)

(** The fundamental properties of Separation Logic operators are described next.
    Numerous other useful properties are derivable from just these. *)

(** (1) The star operator is associative. *)

Parameter hstar_assoc : forall H1 H2 H3,
  (H1 \* H2) \* H3 = H1 \* (H2 \* H3).

(** (2) The star operator is commutative. *)

Parameter hstar_comm : forall H1 H2,
   H1 \* H2 = H2 \* H1.

(** (3) The empty heap predicate is a neutral for the star.
    Because star is commutative, it is equivalent to state that
    [hempty] is a left or a right neutral for [hstar].
    We chose, arbitrarily, to state the left-neutral property. *)

Parameter hstar_hempty_l : forall H,
  \[] \* H = H.

(** (4) Existentials can be "extruded" out of stars, that is:

      [(\exists x, H1) \* H2  =  \exists x, (H1 \* H2)].
      when [x] does not occur in [H2].

    To formalize this equality, we first rewrite it using [hexists]
    instead of the notation [\exists]. We get:
      [(hexists (fun x => J x)) \* H  =  hexists (fun x => (J x \* H))].
    We then recall that [fun x => (J x \* H)] can be written simply as [J \*+ H].
    These observations lead us to the following statement. *)

Parameter hstar_hexists : forall A (J:A->hprop) H,
  (hexists J) \* H = hexists (J \*+ H).

(** (5) Star is "regular" with respect to entailment, in the sense that
    if we have a goal of the form [(H1 \* H2) ==> (H1' \* H2)], then we
    may "cancel out" the [H2] that appears on both sides.

    Here again, due to commutativity of star, it only suffices to state
    the left version of the lemma. *)

Parameter himpl_frame_l : forall H2 H1 H1',
  H1 ==> H1' ->
  (H1 \* H2) ==> (H1' \* H2).

(** These properties are shared by essentially all variants of Separation
    Logic, and many generic results can be derived from these facts alone. *)

(** Remark: in technical vocabulary, the star operator together with the
    empty heap predicate form a "commutative monoid structure", for which
    moreover the star operator is "regular" with respect to entailment
    and existentials. *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Contradictions from absurd separating conjunctions *)

(** A heap predicate of the form [(l ~~~> v1) \* (l ~~~> v2)]
    describes two "disjoint" cells that are both "at location [l]".
    Such a state cannot exist. The contraction is formally captured by
    the following entailment: *)

Lemma hstar_hsingle_same_loc : forall (l:loc) (v1 v2:val),
  (l ~~~> v1) \* (l ~~~> v2) ==> \[False].

(** The proof of this result exploits a result on finite maps.
    Essentially, the domain of a single singleton map that binds
    a location [l] to some value is the singleton set [\{l}], thus
    such a singleton map cannot be disjoint from another singleton
    map that binds the same location [l].
[[
    Check disjoint_single_single_same_inv : forall (l:loc) (v1 v2:val),
      Fmap.disjoint (Fmap.single l v1) (Fmap.single l v2) ->
      False.
]] *)

(** Using this lemma, we can prove [hstar_hsingle_same_loc]
    by unfolding the definition of [hstar] to reveal the
    contradiction on the disjointness assumption. *)

Proof using.
  intros. unfold hsingle. intros h (h1&h2&E1&E2&D&E). false.
  subst. applys Fmap.disjoint_single_single_same_inv D.
Qed.

(** More generally, a heap predicate of the form [H \* H]
    is generally suspicious in Separation Logic. In plain
    Separation Logic, such a predicate can only be satisfied
    if [H] covers no memory cell, that is, if [H] is a pure
    predicate of the form [\[P]] for some proposition [P]. *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** Consequence, frame, and their combination *)

(** The rule of consequence in Separation Logic is similar
    to that in Hoared logic. *)

Parameter triple_conseq : forall t H Q H' Q',
  triple t H' Q' ->
  H ==> H' ->
  Q' ===> Q ->
  triple t H Q.

(** Recall the frame rule introduced in the previous chapter. *)

Parameter triple_frame : forall t H Q H',
  triple t H Q ->
  triple t (H \* H') (Q \*+ H').

(** Observe that, stated as such, it is very unlikely for the
    frame rule to be applicable in practice, because the
    precondition must be exactly of the form [H \* H'] and
    the postcondition exactly of the form [Q \*+ H'] where [H']
    denotes the heap predicate to be framed. For example,
    the frame rule would not apply directly to a conclusion of the
    form [triple t (H' \* H) (Q \*+ H')]

    This limitation of the frame rule can be addressed by combining
    the frame rule with the rule of consequence, as follows.
    Observe that the new statement applies to any triple. It is
    the user's responsability to explicitly provide either [H1]
    (the precondition that remains) or [H2] (the part of the
    precondition being framed). *)

Lemma triple_conseq_frame : forall H2 H1 Q1 t H Q,
  triple t H1 Q1 ->
  H ==> H1 \* H2 ->
  Q1 \*+ H2 ===> Q ->
  triple t H Q.

(* EX1! (triple_conseq_frame) *)
(** Prove the combined consequence-frame rule. *)

Proof using. (* ADMITTED *)
  introv M WH WQ. applys triple_conseq WH WQ.
  applys triple_frame M.
Qed. (* /ADMITTED *)

(** [] *)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** The extraction rules *)

(** From an entailment [(\[P] \* H) ==> H'], it is useful
    to extract [P] into the context, and turn the goal into:
    [P -> (H ==> H')].

    Likewise, for a goal [triple t (\[P] \* H) Q], it is
    useful to extract [P] into the context, and turn the goal into:
    [P -> triple t H Q].

    The structural rule called [triple_hpure] captures this
    extraction of the pure facts. *)

Parameter triple_hpure : forall t (P:Prop) H Q,
  (P -> triple t H Q) ->
  triple t (\[P] \* H) Q.

(** From an entailment [(\exists x, (J x) ==> H], it is useful
    to extract [x] into the context, and turn the goal into:
    [forall x, (J x ==> H)].

    Likewise, for a goal [triple t (\exists x, (J x)) Q], it is
    useful to extract [x] into the context, and turn the goal into:
    [forall x, triple t (J x) Q].

    The structural rule called [triple_hexists] captures this
    extraction of the existential quantifier. *)

Parameter triple_hexists : forall t (A:Type) (J:A->hprop) Q,
  (forall x, triple t (J x) Q) ->
  triple t (hexists J) Q.

(* ******************************************************* *)
(** ** The [xsimpl] tactic *)

(** The Separation Logic setup that we will rely on in subsequent
    chapters includes a tactic called [xsimpl] to assist in the
    simplifications of entailment relations.

    The working of [xsimpl] can be summarized as a 3-step process:

    1. extract pure facts and existential quantifiers from the LHS,
    2. cancel out equal predicates occuring both in the LHS and RHS,
    3. instantiate existential quantifiers (using either evars or
       user-provided hints) and generate subgoals for the pure facts
       occuring in the RHS.

    These steps are detailed and illustrated next.

    The tactic [xpull] is a degraded version of [xsimpl] that only
    performs the first step. We will show examples highlighting its use.
*)


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** *** [xsimpl] to extract pure facts and quantifiers in LHS *)

(** The first feature of [xsimpl] is its ability to extract the
    pure facts and the existential quantifiers from the left-hand
    side out into the Coq context.

    For example, the proposition [P] appears in the LHS.
    After calling [xsimpl], it is turned into an hypothesis
    at the head of the goal, hypothesis that may subsequently
    be introduced. *)

(** Similarly, any existential quantifier from the LHS is turned
    into a universally-quantified variable outside of the entailment. *)

  H1 \* \exists (n:int), (p ~~~> n \* H2) \* H3 ==> H4.

(** The [xsimpl] or [xpull] tactic extracts at once everything it can,
    as illustrated next. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_lhs_several : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 (p q:loc),
  H1 \* \exists (n:int), (p ~~~> n \* \[n > 0] \* H2) \* \[p <> q] \* H3 ==> H4.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl. intros n Hn Hp.
Abort.

(** This task is also performed by the simpler tactic [xpull]. *)

Proof using.
  intros. xpull. intros n Hn Hp.
Abort.


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** *** [xsimpl] to cancel out heap predicates from LHS and RHS *)

(** The second feature of [xsimpl] is its ability to cancel out
    similar heap predicates that occur on both sides of an entailment.

    For example, [H2] occurs on both sides, so it can be cancelled out. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_cancel_one : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 H7,
  H1 \* H2 \* H3 \* H4 ==> H5 \* H6 \* H2 \* H7.
Proof using.

(** [xsimpl] actually cancels out all the heap predicates that it
    can spot to appear on both sides. Here, [H2], [H3], and [H4]. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_cancel_many : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 H5,
  H1 \* H2 \* H3 \* H4 ==> H4 \* H3 \* H5 \* H2.

Qed.


(* ******************************************************* *)
(** *** [xsimpl] to instantiate pure facts and quantifiers in RHS *)

(** The third feature of [xsimpl] is its ability to instantiate
    existential quantifiers and pure facts in the RHS.

    Let us first illustrate how it deals with pure facts,
    by spawning subgoals. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hpure : forall H1 H2 H3 (n:int),
  H1 ==> H2 \* \[n > 0] \* H3.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl.
Abort.

(** In the face of a quantifier in the RHS, the [xsimpl] tactic
    introduces an evar. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hexists : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 (p:loc),
  H1 ==> H2 \* \exists (n:int), (p ~~~> n \* H3) \* H4.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl. (* here, [p ~~~> n] becomes [p ~~~> ?x] *)
Abort.

(** The evar often gets subsequently instantiated as a result of
    a cancellation with a matching item from the LHS. For example: *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hexists_unify : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 (p:loc),
  H1 \* (p ~~~> 3) ==> H2 \* \exists (n:int), (p ~~~> n \* H3) \* H4.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl. (* [p ~~~> n] becomes [p ~~~> ?x],
                     which then cancels out with [p ~~~> 3] *)
Abort.

(** The instantiation of the evar (e.g., [n]) can be observed if there
    is another occurence of the same variable in the entailment. For example: *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hexists_unify_view : forall H1 H2 H3 (p:loc),
  H1 \* (p ~~~> 3) ==> H2 \* \exists (n:int), (p ~~~> n \* \[n > 0]) \* H3.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl. (* [p ~~~> n] unifies with [p ~~~> 3], then [3 > 0] remains. *)
Abort.

(** (Advanced.) In some cases, it may desirable to provide an explicit value
    to instantiate the existential quantifiers from the RHS.
    Such values may be passed as arguments to [xsimpl],
    using the syntax [xsimpl v1 .. vn] or [xsimpl (>> v1 .. vn)]. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hints : forall H1 (p q:loc),
  H1 ==> \exists (n m:int), (p ~~~> n \* q ~~~> m).
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl 3 4.
Abort.

(** (Advanced.) It is possible to provide hint for only a subset of the quantifier,
    using the placeholder value [__] for arguments that should be instantiated
    using evars. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hints_evar : forall H1 (p q:loc),

(** ** Proofs for the Separation Algebra *)

(** We next show the details of the proofs establishing the
    commutative monoid structure with the frame property.

    Note that these results must be proved without help of
    the tactic [xsimpl], because the implementation of the
    tactic itself depends on these key lemmas.

    To establish the properties, we need to exploit a few
    basic facts about finite maps; we will introduce them as
    we go along. *)

(* EX1! (himpl_frame_l) *)
(** The simplest result to derive is the frame lemma for entailment.
    To establish it, you will need to unfold the definition of [hstar]. *)
