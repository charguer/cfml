(* ########################################################### *)
(** * Welcome *)

(** This electronic book is Volume 5 of the _Software Foundations_
    series, which presents the mathematical underpinnings of reliable
    software.

    In this volume, you will learn about the foundations of Separation
    Logic, which is a practical approach for the modular verification
    of imperative programs.

    You are assumed to understand the material in Software Foundations
    Volume 1 (Logic Foundations), and the two chapters on Hoare Logic
    (Hoare and Hoare2) from Software Foundations Volume 2 (PL
    Foundations).

    The exposition here is intended for a broad range of readers, from
    advanced undergraduates to PhD students and researchers.  *)

(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Chapters *)

(** The "Separation Logic Foundations" course includes the following chapters.

    - [SLFPreface]: the present introduction.

    - [SLFBasic]: examples of specifications and verification proofs, using
                  basic imperative programs.

    - [SLFList]:  specification and verification proofs for mutable lists
                  and mutable stacks.

    - [SLFHprop]: definition of the core operators of Separation Logic,
                  of Hoare triples, and of Separation Logic triples.

    - [SLFHimpl]: definition of the entailment relation, statement and proof
                  of its fundamental properties, and description of the
                  simplification tactic for entailment.

    - [SLFRules]: statement and proofs of the reasoning rules of Separation Logic,
                  and examples of complete verification proofs.

    - [SLFWPsem]: definition of the semantic notion of weakest precondition,
                  and statement of reasoning rules in weakest-precondition style.

    - [SLFWPgen]: presentation of a function that effectively computes weakest
                  preconditions, and description of the construction of a set up
                  that leads to concise verification proofs.

    - [SLFWand]:  introduction of the magic wand, of the ramified frame rule,
                  and recursive computation of weakest precondition inside functions.

(** ** Special chapters *)

(**
    - [SLFDirect]: This file provides the minimal set of definitions and lemmas
                   required to build a practical program verification tool,
                   without detour. This file is mostly self-contained; it depends
                   only on the representation of variables, of finite maps, and
                   on the implementation of the entailment simplification tactic
                   (i.e., auxiliary files [Var.v], [Fmap.v], and [SepSimpl.v]).
                   Note that the file [SLFDirect] contains a minimal amount of
                   comments; explanations are given in the main course chapters.

    - [SLFExtra]:  This file recaps the definition and lemmas that are presented
                   in the main course chapters but that are not included in the
                   file [SLFDirect]. Again, this file serves as a reference, and
                   does not contain further explanations.

(* ########################################################### *)
(** * Organization of each chapters *)

(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Three levels of reading *)

(** Each chapter contains three parts:
    - the "chapter in a rush" part, which presents the main take-away messages,
    - the "detailed contents" part, with presentation of important technical results,
    - the "optional contents" part, intended for those who seek a deeper understanding,
      or wish so work on additional exercises.

    The course is organized so that:
    - reading only the "in a rush" parts of every chapter should make sense,
    - all the "optional contents" parts are independent: they may be read,
      partially read, or skipped, without consequences on the other chapters.

    For the first two chapters, the "detailed contents" material consists of
    exercises that are interleaved with the "chapter in a rush" material.
    For the other chapters, the tree parts are consecutive (i.e., not interleaved).

*)

(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Exercises *)

(** Each chapter includes numerous exercises.  The star rating scheme in
    use is described in the Preface of Volume 1. *)


(* ########################################################### *)
(** * Practicalities *)

(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** System Requirements *)

(** The Preface of Volume 1 describes the Coq installation you will
    need. This edition was built with $(COQVERSION). *)

(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Note for CoqIDE users *)

(** CoqIDE works better with its "asynchronous" proof mode disabled.
    To load all the course files in CoqIDE, use the following command line.

[[
	coqide -async-proofs off -async-proofs-command-error-resilience off -Q . SLF SLF*.v &
]]

*)

(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** TLC: tactics and libraries *)

(** The proofs are carried out using tactics from the TLC library.
    These tactics greatly help. Most of the tactics used are described
    in the chapter [UseTactics] from the "Programming Language Foundations"
    (PLF) course.

    The first two chapters, [SLFBasic] and [SLFList], are careful to use as
    few TLC tactics as possible, and to explain the ones that are used.
    In the other chapters, TLC tactics are used in proof scripts to improve
    conciseness, however familiarity with these tactics should not be
    necessary to follow through the proofs. All exercises can be carried
    out without using TLC tactics.

    Note that a few proofs also rely occasionally on lemmas from the
    TLC library, for example extensionality properties, or results on lists.
    Such lemmas are described whenever they are relevant to a proof. *)


(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** CFML: a practical verification tool *)

(** CFML is a program verification framework based on Separation
    Logic and embedded in Coq. The present course presents, among
    other things, the foundations of the CFML tool.

    The first two chapters, [SLFBasic] and [SLFList], present
    verification proofs that are conducted using CFML.

    The other chapters build a mini-CFML from scratch, and present
    practical verification proofs based on that mini-CFML. *)


(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Imports between files *)

(** To simplify the compilation process, copies of the source files from
    the TLC and the CFML libraries are included in the present folder.
    There is no need to look at these files. *)

(** The first two chapters, [SLFBasic] and [SLFList], leverage the
    CFML tool, by importing the CFML library file [Example.v].

    The other chapters are independent from the CFML library. They only
    exploit a few generic library files ([Var.v] for variables, [Fmap.v]
    for finite maps, and [SepSimpl.v] for the hi-tech Separation Logic
    simplification tactic). *)

(** The chapters introduce Separation Logic definitions and lemmas
    layer by layer.

    Several chapters import definitions from the previous layer.
    Other chapters instead import definitions from the files [SLFDirect.v]
    and [SLFExtra.v], which summarize all the definitions of the course.
    Which definitions are imported should be essentially transparent to
    the reader.

    There is one notable exception: the definition of the core operators
    of Separation Logic are set [Opaque] in [SLFDirect]. Doing so benefits
    to abstraction: one may no longer "unfold" the core definitions.
    Instead, one must work exclusively using the high-level lemmas that
    characterize the useful properties of the definitions. *)

(** * Dissemination *)

(* LATER:

    Downloading the Coq Files

    A tar file containing the full sources for the "release version"
    of this book (as a collection of Coq scripts and HTML files) is
    available at https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu.

    (If you are using the book as part of a class, your teacher may
    give you access to a locally modified version of the files, which
    you should use instead of the release version.) *)
