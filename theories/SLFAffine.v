(** * Chapter in a rush *)

(** The Separation Logic framework that we have constructed is well-suited
    for a language with explicit deallocation, but cannot be used as such for
    a language equipped with a garbage collector. As we pointed out in the
    chapter [SLFBasic], there is no rule in Separation Logic that allows
    discarding a heap predicate from the precondition or the postcondition.

    In this chapter, we explain how to generalize the Separation Logic
    framework to support a "garbage collection rule", which one may invoke
    in the logic to discard predicates describing allocated data, thereby
    reflecting on the action of the garbage collector. The resulting
    framework is said to describe an "affine" logic, as opposed to a "linear"
    logic.

    This chapter is organized as follows:

    - first, we recall the example demonstrating the need for a new rule,
    - second, we present the statement of the "garbage collection rule",
    - third, we show how to refine the definition of Separation Logic
      triples, so as to accomodate the new rule.

    Although in the present course we consider a language for which it is
    desirable that any heap predicate can be discarded, we will present
    general definitions allowing to fine-tune which heap predicates can
    be discarded and which cannot be discarded by the user. We will argue
    why such a fine-tuning may be interesting. *)

(** ** Motivation for the garbage collection rule *)

Module MotivatingExample.
Export DemoPrograms.

(** Let us recall the example of the function [succ_using_incr_attempt]
    from chapter [SLFBasic]. This function allocates a reference with
    contents [n], then increments that reference, and finally returning
    its contents, that is, [n+1]. Let us revisit this example, with
    this time the intention of establishing for it a postcondition that
    does not leak the existence of a left-over reference cell.

[[
    let succ_using_incr n =
      let p = ref n in
      incr p;
      !p
]]

*)

Definition succ_using_incr :=
  VFun 'n :=
    Let 'p := 'ref 'n in
    incr 'p ';
    '! 'p.

(** In the framework developed so far, the heap predicate describing the
    reference cell allocated by the function cannot be discarded by the
    user, because the code does not feature a deallocation operation.
    As a result, the user is forced to include in the postcondition the
    description of a left-over reference. *)

Lemma Triple_succ_using_incr : forall (n:int),
  TRIPLE (succ_using_incr n)

Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. intros ? p ->. xapp. xapp. xsimpl. auto.
Qed.

(** If we try to prove a specification that does not mention the left-over
    reference, we get stuck with a proof obligation of the form 
    [p ~~~> (n+1) ==> \[]]. *)

    POST (fun r => \[r = n+1]).
Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. intros ? p ->. xapp. xapp. xsimpl. { auto. } (* stuck here *)
Abort.

(** This situation is desirable in a programming language with explicit
    deallocation, because it ensures that the code written by the
    programmer is not missing any deallocation operation. However, it is
    ill-suited for a programming language equipped with a garbage collector
    that performs deallocation automatically.

    In this chapter, we present an "affine" version of Separation Logic,
    where the above function [succ_using_incr_attempt] admits the
    postcondition [fun r => \[r = n+1]], and needs not mention the
    left-over reference. *)

(** ** Statement of the garbage collection rule *)

(** There are several ways to state a "garbage collection rule" and its
    corrolaries. We present them next. *)

(** The most direct presentation of the "garbage collection rule" allows
    one to freely discard any piece of state from the postcondition.

    More precisely, this rule, named [triple_hany_post], asserts that an
    arbitrary heap predicate [H'] can be dropped from the postcondition. *)

Parameter triple_hany_post : forall t H H' Q,
  triple t H (Q \*+ H') ->
  triple t H Q.

(** A symmetric rule, named [triple_hany_pre], asserts that an arbitrary
    heap predicate [H'] can be dropped from the precondition. *)

Parameter triple_hany_pre : forall t H H' Q,
  triple t H Q ->
  triple t (H \* H') Q.

(** As we prove further on, the rule [triple_hany_pre] can be derived from
    [triple_hany_post] using the frame rule, but not vice-versa. Thus, we
    thereafter focus on the more general rule [triple_hany_post], which
    operates on the postcondition. *)

(** Let us show that, using this rule [triple_hany_post], we can derive
    the desired specification for the motivating example from the
    specification that mentions the left-over postcondition. *)

(** ** Fine-grained control on collectable predicates *)

(** As suggested in the introduction, it may be useful to constraint
    the garbage collection rule so that it can be used to discard
    only certain types of heap predicates, but not all. For example,
    even in a programming language featuring a garbage collector,
    it may be useful to ensure that every file handle opened eventually
    gets closed, or that every lock acquired eventually gets released.
    File handles and locks are example of resources that may be
    described in Separation Logic, yet should not be freely discarded.

    As another example, consider the extension of Separation Logic with
    "time credits", which are used for complexity analysis. In such a
    setting, it is desirable to throw away a positive number of credits
    to reflect for over-approximations, however it must be ruled out to
    throw away negative number of credits, as this would compromise
    the soundness of the framework. *)

(** To constraint the garbage collection rule and allow fine-tuning
    of which heap predicates may be thrown away, we introduce the notion
    of "affine predicates", captured by a judgment written [haffine H].
    The idea is that only predicates satisyfing [haffine] may get freely
    discarded. *)

Parameter haffine : hprop -> Prop.

Parameter triple_haffine_post : forall t H H' Q,
  haffine H' ->
  triple t H (Q \*+ H') ->
  triple t H Q.

(** The variant of the garbage collection rule that operates on the
    precondition is constrained in a similar way. *)

Parameter triple_haffine_pre : forall t H H' Q,
  haffine H' ->
  triple t H Q ->
  triple t (H \* H') Q.

(** The definition of [haffine] should be set up in such a way that
    this predicate distributes in the expected way on each of the
    Separation Logic operators, as captured by the following lemma. *)

Parameter haffine_hempty :
  haffine \[].

Parameter haffine_hpure : forall P,
  haffine \[P].

Parameter haffine_hstar : forall H1 H2,

  (forall x, haffine (J x)) ->
  haffine (\exists x, (J x)).

Parameter haffine_hforall : forall A `{Inhab A} (J:A->hprop),
  (forall x, haffine (J x)) ->
  haffine (\forall x, (J x)).

(** In addition, [haffine] distributes on the heap predicate [\[P] \* H] 
    by providing the hypothesis [P], because if a heap [h] satifies 
    [\[P] \* H] then it must be the case that the proposition [P] is true. *)

Parameter haffine_hstar_hpure : forall P H,
  (P -> haffine H) ->
  haffine (\[P] \* H).

(** We will present further on a template for defining [haffine] in
    a way that guarantees by construction that all these properties
    indeed hold. *)


(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** The garbage collection heap predicate *)

(** We now introduce a new heap predicate that is very handy for
    describing "pieces of heap to be garbage collected". We will
    use it to reformulate the garbage collection rule is a more
    concise and more usable way.

    This heap predicate is named [hgc] and is written [\GC].
    We define it as "some heap predicate [H] that satisfies [haffine]",
    as formalized next. *)

Definition hgc : hprop :=
  \exists H, \[haffine H] \* H.

Notation "\GC" := (hgc).

(** Observe that the heap predicate [\GC] is itself affine.
    Indeed, [\GC] denotes some heap [H] such that [haffine H] holds.
    Thus, by essence, it denotes an affine heap predicate. *)

Lemma haffine_hgc :
  haffine \GC.
Proof using.
  applys haffine_hexists. intros H. applys haffine_hstar_hpure. auto.
Qed.

(** Using the predicate [\GC], we can reformulate the constrained
    garbage collection rule [triple_haffine_post] as follows. *)

Parameter triple_hgc_post : forall t H Q,
  triple t H (Q \*+ \GC) ->
  triple t H Q.

(** Not only is this rule more concise, it also has the benefits
    that the piece of heap discarded, previously described by [H']
    no longer needs to be provided upfront at the moment of applying
    the rule. It may be provided later on in the reasoning, by
    instantiating the existential quantifier carried into the
    definition of the [\GC] predicate, a.k.a., [hgc]. *)

(** The process of exploiting the [\GC] to "absorb" affine heap predicates
    is captured by the following lemma, which asserts that a heap predicate [H]
    entails [\GC] whenever [H] is affine. *)

Lemma himpl_hgc_r : forall H,
  haffine H ->
  H ==> \GC.
Proof using.
  introv M. unfold hgc. applys himpl_hexists_r H.
  applys* himpl_hstar_hpure_r.
Qed.

(** In particular, the empty heap predicate [\[]] entails [\GC], because the
    empty heap predicate is affine (recall lemma [haffine_hempty]). *)

Lemma hempty_himpl_hgc :
  \[] ==> \GC.
Proof using. applys himpl_hgc_r. applys haffine_hempty. Qed.

(** The tactic [xsimpl] is extended with specific support for the
    predicate [\GC]. In particular, [xsimpl] simplifies goals of the
    form [H ==> \GC] by turning them into [haffine H] using the above
    lemma. The tactic then tries to discharge [haffine H] by means that
    depend on the choice of the definition of [haffine]. *)


(* ########################################################### *)
(** ** Exploiting the garbage collection in proofs *)

(** In a verification proof, there are two ways to discard heap
    predicates that are no longer needed:

    - either by invoking [triple_haffine_pre] to remove a specific
      predicate from the current state, i.e., the precondition;
    - or by invoking [triple_htop_post] to add a [\GC] into the
      current postcondition and allow subsequent removal of any
      predicate that may be left-over in the final entailment
      justifying that the final state satisfies the postcondition.

    Eager removal of predicates from the current state is never
    necessary: one can be lazy and postpone the application of
    the garbage collection rule until the last step of reasoning.

    To that end, it suffices to anticipate, right from the beginning
    of the verification proof, the possibility of discarding heap
    predicates from the final state, when proving that it entails
    the postcondition. Concretely, it suffices to apply the rule
    [triple_htop_post] as very first step of the proof to extend
    the postcondition with a [\GC] predicate, which will be used
    to "capture" all the garbage left-over at the end of the proof.

    We implement this strategy once-and-forall by integrating directly
    the rule [triple_htop_post] into the tactic [xwp], which sets up
    the verification proof by computing the characteristic formula.
    To that end, we generalize the lemma [xwp_lemma], which the tactic
    [xwp] applies. Its original statement is as follows. *)

Parameter xwp_lemma : forall v1 v2 x t1 H Q,
  v1 = val_fun x t1 ->
  H ==> wpgen ((x,v2)::nil) t1 Q ->
  triple (trm_app v1 v2) H Q.

(** Its generalized form extends the postcondition to which the formula
    computed by [wpgen] is applied from [Q] to [Q \*+ \GC], as shown below. *)

Lemma xwp_lemma' : forall v1 v2 x t1 H Q,
  v1 = val_fun x t1 ->
  H ==> wpgen ((x,v2)::nil) t1 (Q \*+ \GC) ->
  triple (trm_app v1 v2) H Q.
Proof using. introv E M. applys triple_hgc_post. applys* xwp_lemma. Qed.

(** Let us update the tactic [xwp] to exploit the above lemma. *)

Tactic Notation "xwp" :=
  intros; applys xwp_lemma';
  [ reflexivity | simpl; unfold wpgen_var; simpl ].

(** Using the updated version of [xwp], the proof of [succ_using_incr]
    in a fully-affine logic works out very smoothly, the left-over
    reference being automatically absorbed into the [\GC] predicate 
    by [xsimpl]. *)

(** In the toy language that we consider, every predicate may be

(** On the contrary, one can stick to a "linear" Separation Logic

(** ** Refined definition of Separation Logic triples *)

Module NewTriples.

(** In what follows, we explain how to refine the notion of Separation
    Logic triple so as to accomodate the garbage collection rule.

    Recall the definition of triple for a linear logic.

[[
    Definition triple (t:trm) (H:hprop) (Q:val->hprop) : Prop :=
      forall (H':hprop), hoare t (H \* H') (Q \*+ H').
]]

    The garbage collection rule [triple_htop_post] asserts that
    postconditions may be freely extended with the [\GC] predicate.
    To support this rule, it suffices to modify the definition of
    [triple] to include the predicate [\GC] in the postcondition
    of the underlying Hoare triple, as follows. *)

Definition triple (t:trm) (H:hprop) (Q:val->hprop) : Prop :=
  forall (H':hprop), hoare t (H \* H') (Q \*+ H' \*+ \GC).

(** Again, keep in mind that this definition of [triple] is strictly
    more general than the previous one. Indeed, as explained earlier on,
    by instantiating [haffine] as the predicate [fun (H:hprop) => \[]],
    the predicate [\GC] becomes equivalent to the empty predicate [\[]].
    In that case, [\GC] can be replaced with [\[]], which simplifies away;
    we thus recover exactly the previous definition of [triple]. *)

(** For the refined definition of [triple] using [\GC], one can prove that:

    - all the existing reasoning rules for linear triples remain sound;
    - the rule [triple_htop_post] is sound;
    - the rule [triple_haffine_hpost] and [triple_haffine_hpre] can
      be derived from [triple_htop_post] and the other structural rules.

    The proofs appear scattered through the remaining of this chapter.

    One fundamental property that appears necessary in many of the proof
    is the following lemma, which asserts that two occurences of [\GC]
    can always be collapsed into one. *)

Lemma hstar_hgc_hgc :
  \GC \* \GC = \GC.

    Advanced remark: the above remark can be mitigated. If we expose
    that [triple t H Q <-> triple t' H Q] holds whenever [t] and [t']
    are observationally equivalent with respect to the semantics
    defined by [eval], and if we are able to prove that [let x = t in x]
    is observationally equivalent to [t] for some fresh variable x,
    then it is possible to prove that [triple_htop_post] is derivable
    from [triple_htop_pre]. Indeed, the postcondition of [t] can be viewed
    as the precondition of the [x] occuring in the right-hand side of the
    term [let x = t in x]. Thus, discarding a heap predicate from the
    postcondition of [t] can be simulated by discarding a heap predicate
    from the precondition of [x]. *)

(** As explained when introducing the predicate [haffine], the definition of this

    An easy way to obtain a well-behaved definition of [haffine] is to first define
    the notion of "affine heap", written [heap_affine h], and then derive the notion
    of "affine heap predicate", written [haffine H]. The latter is defined as the set
    of heap predicates that characterize only affine heaps, that is, the predicates
    [H] such that [forall h, H h -> heap_affine h].

(** ** Low-level definition of refined triples *)

Module LowLevel.

(** In chapter [SLFHprop], we presented an alternative definition for
    Separation Logic triples, called [triple_lowlevel], expressed directly
    in terms of heaps.

[[
    Definition triple_lowlevel (t:trm) (H:hprop) (Q:val->hprop) : Prop :=
      forall h1 h2,
      Fmap.disjoint h1 h2 ->
      H h1 ->
      exists h1' v,
           Fmap.disjoint h1' h2
        /\ eval (h1 \u h2) t (h1' \u h2) v
        /\ Q v h1'.
]]

    In what follows, we explain how to generalize this definition to match
    our revised definition of [triple].

    One could simply reproduce the definition above and replace the last
    conclusion, stated on the last line, with:

[[
        (Q \*+ \GC) v h1'
]]

    as this would match the fact that our definition of triples evolved from
    [forall (H':hprop), hoare (H \* H') t (Q \*+ H')] to
    [forall (H':hprop), hoare (H \* H') t (Q \*+ H' \*+ \GC)].

    However, this would be somewhat cheating, because the entire point of a
    direct definition in terms of heap is to not depend on the definition of
    [hstar] nor of other Separation Logic operators such as [\GC].

    Let us aim instead for a direct definition, entirely expressed in terms
    of union of heaps. To that end, we need to introduce an additional piece of
    state to describe the piece of the final heap covered by the [\GC] predicate.

    We will need to describe the disjointness of the 3 pieces of heap that
    describe the final state. To that end, we first introduce the auxiliary
    definition [Fmap.disjoint_3 h1 h2 h3], which asserts that the three arguments
    denote pairwise disjoint heaps. *)

Definition fmap_disjoint_3 (h1 h2 h3:heap) : Prop :=
     Fmap.disjoint h1 h2
  /\ Fmap.disjoint h2 h3
  /\ Fmap.disjoint h1 h3.

(** We then formulate [triple_lowlevel] using a final state of the from
    [h1' \u h2 \u h3'] instead of just [h1' \u h2]. There, [h3'] denotes
    the piece of the final state covered by the [\GC] heap predicate.
    This piece of state is an affine heap, as captured by [heap_affine h3']. *)

Definition triple_lowlevel (t:trm) (H:hprop) (Q:val->hprop) : Prop :=
  forall h1 h2,
  Fmap.disjoint h1 h2 ->
  H h1 ->
  exists v h1' h3',
       fmap_disjoint_3 h1' h2 h3'
    /\ heap_affine h3'
    /\ eval (h1 \u h2) t (h1' \u h2 \u h3') v
    /\ Q v h1'.

(** One can prove the equivalence of [triple] and [triple_lowlevel]
    following a similar proof pattern as previously. The proof is a bit
    more technical and requires additional tactic support to deal with
    the tedious disjointness conditions, so we omit the details here. *)
